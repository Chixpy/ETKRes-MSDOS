Osiris was once a pharaoh of the Old Egypt, ruling the land in happiness, as it enjoyed great prosperity. But his evil brother Set was envious of him. He killed Osiris and cut his body in pieces. Now the ka (soul) of Osiris is standing in front of the entrance to the World of the Dead, unable to find solace. Defeating Set is the only way to end the torment. But in order to do that, Osiris will have to return his body, scattered around the land, devoured by wild animals. He will have to restore his body, absorb the spirits of animals, and challenge his treacherous brother in a final battle...

The Seven Spirits of Ra is a follow-up to  ICON: Quest for the RING, sharing much of its predecessor"s gameplay and interface features. The player navigates Osiris through various environments in ancient Egypt, in a mixture of top-down and side-scrolling views, eliminating enemies in simple action-based combat. The role-playing element is less noticeable in the game compared to its predecessor; however, the world is larger and offers more exploration possibilities.

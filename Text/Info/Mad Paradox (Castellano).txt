Mad Paradox is a Japanese-style role-playing game. A man named Gorgus has killed your father, and you have to find the villain and to avenge your father"s death. Moving around your hero through towns and dungeons in top-down view, you must fight (in turn-based combat style) many monsters, gather experience points, and collect items. The game also features some scenes with naked women, and many sub-quests involve saving girls and then enjoying their anime-style pictures.

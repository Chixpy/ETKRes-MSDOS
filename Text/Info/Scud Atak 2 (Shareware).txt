You command missile defense posts protecting your city buildings against incoming SCUD missiles which attack each hour.  Your defenses include 3 missile bases.  Each base is initially stocked with 10 missiles.  Every three hours a truck will appear to resupply your armaments.  This means that you must ration your missiles to maintain an adequate supply to destroy all three rounds of enemy attacks between each resupply stage.  Each enemy attack round includes numerous SCUDs, enemy bomber(s), and possibly satellite bombers.  Some of the SCUDs are actually clusters of missiles that will split into several individual missiles. If any missile impacts a city building it will be destroyed.  If a missile impacts a missile base you will lose all missiles remaining at that base until the base is resupplied.  If all cities are destroy you are relieved of command and your tour is over.

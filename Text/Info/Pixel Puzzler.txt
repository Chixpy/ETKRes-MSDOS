This program takes graphic files, splits them into squares and shuffles the squares around.  By selecting two squares with the keyboard or mouse, the player can swap their locations on the screen.  The object is to reassemble the image to its original appearance.  A variety of now-obscure graphics formats are supported: *.PIC, *.SCN, *.BSP, *.BSS, *.PAK, *.PBL, *.IFF and *.LBM.  The puzzles can scale from 32 to 256 pieces in size.  It is possible to save and later reload a puzzle in progress.  The program also comes with Pixel Puzzle Maker, a utility which allows Print Shop clip art to be used to create new *.BSP graphics for use in the Puzzler.

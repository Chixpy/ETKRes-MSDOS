Six years after the release of Hanse, Ralf Glau released an enhanced version of his classic game.The game principle stayed the same, it"s a historical trading simulation based on the trading association Hanse. The game has been touched-up with very nice SVGA illustrations, some adlib music tracks and a couple of new game aspects. One of them is that you can have childs, destined to be sent on expeditions to conquer new areas of trade. Overall a decent game - however I like the "simplicity" of the original a bit more. As usual with this kind of game, it"s best played together with some friends - up to six in all. Try a slow-down util with the install program, if you get runtime errors.

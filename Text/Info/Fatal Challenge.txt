Fatal Challenge is a simple fighting game which takes place on an urban rooftop. The challengers Ken and Roc fight three rounds for seemingly a neverending number of levels. Both fighters are identical save for a grey vest and camo pants that Roc wears as opposed to Ken"s skins and green pants get-up. Two players can face each other or one player can play the computer. The controls are fairly simplistic in that the player can jump, punch, move, and kick. Jumping kicks as well as throws are possible with the combination of right keys.

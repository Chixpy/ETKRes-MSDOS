Based on a game called "Jet Set Willy" which originally appeared for the somewhat obscure (in North America, anyways) ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC computer platforms back in the 80"s, Top Hat Willy is a decent sidescrolling games. It"s definitely no match for much more polished efforts from, say, Apogee or Epic Megagames, but if you remember folding playing Jet Set Willy back in the day, give this one a go, since as far as I can tell it is a decent remake (and also includes improvements over the original.)

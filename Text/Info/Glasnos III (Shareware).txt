Glasnos III is closer to the original Tetris than Gravtris, Murray Brandon"s other game. But the blocks have odd shapes, the well is turned by 90\u00b0, and most of all there are no less than 35 bonuses (both good and bad) and several special blocks. To memorize what they all do is a chore, so in the end Glasnos III is more like a hazard game

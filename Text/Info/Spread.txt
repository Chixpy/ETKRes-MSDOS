Spread is a fun freeware two-player board game from Korea with a simple premise: change the color of all your opponent"s pieces into yours.The rules are straightforward: you can move your piece on square at a time, or jump over another piece. All the opponenet"s pieces that are adjacent to your piece once you land in a new square will become yours (i.e. change to your color). The goal is to be the one with most pieces remaining on the board when there are no more empty tiles to play, or annihilate your opponent completely. The game is fast, fun, and the computer puts up a pretty decent fight even in "Easy" mode. You can also play against another human being if you wish. Recommended!

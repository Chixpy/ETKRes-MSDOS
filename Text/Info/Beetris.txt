This is the first game of Simsalabim Software, the authors of Frac and Frac4D. It runs without problems under XP on fast computers.

The finish shows a love for detail, the eyes of the bee follow the pieces on their way down, and there is a pause.txt (if the game doesn"t find one, it will create one) that displays when you pause the game with Esc.

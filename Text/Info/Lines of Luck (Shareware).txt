This is a gambling game, modelled after the Lucky Lines-style games which are popping up everywhere. Basically, for those of you not exposed to this game before, it"s an enhanced one-armed bandit style slot machine, with 9 wheels instead of just three. As a result, there are eight different lines you may win on (3 horizontal, 3 vertical, and 2 diagonal), so a little strategy is involved.

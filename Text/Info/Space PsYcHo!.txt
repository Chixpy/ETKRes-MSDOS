"Info for people that post Q-Basic games: Feel free to post this game and
"distribute it and stuff under one condition, it remains unedited.
"
"For those of you out there that want to use parts of the code, feel free,
"whether it be the "moving" subs or the graphics, but put in a word that
"the code was from Hacksoft.
"
"WHEW!  With that said, play this game.  It"s pretty fun, and the graphics
"are better than some we"ve seen from other Q-Basic games.  There are three
"levels, and it"s not the "same thing again just tougher"-type gameplay.
"Space Psycho comes with built-in instructions, a weak story, and three
"levels.  This game is kind of a twist between gore and humor.  Level 1 puts
"you in the heart of the police headquarters and you use your shotgun to
"blast your way out, taking civilians and other cyber-cops.  Level 2 takes
"you onto the streets of Washington D.C., to continue the onslaught.  And
"level 3, there you get to hunt down the president, and you"ll be
"surprised to find out who the 24th century president is!  One of this
"game"s cool features is that you can shoot up enemies again and again,
"blasting off body parts after each shot.  (If you"re looking for a way
"to relieve your anxiety or not always be the "good guy" in a game, then
"give this one a try!)

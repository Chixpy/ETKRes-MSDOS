An original puzzle game that could be considered a precursor to the recent CD-ROM game Safecracker, Revelation is all about cracking safes-- hundreds of them.The goal is to match colors for each safe by turning the dials to open all safes at once. Time limit is very tough even for the beginning levels, so if you finish this game, consider yourself grandmaster thief.

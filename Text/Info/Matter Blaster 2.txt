Looking for a really crazy shooting/action game that doesn"t make a lot of sense, but involves a lot of acton? Matter Blaster might be the game for you. It"s a 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player contest (or you can play alone against the computer) where the object is to just blow up your opponent(s). The game"s graphics and sounds aren"t very good but the action is indeed frantic. I can"t see playing this one for a long period of time but it may be fun in short bursts.

"Why Do I (series) is a fun, brief series which makes its points by including specific, real-world examples of MATHEMATICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, HISTORICAL, SCIENTIFIC, and linguistic (ENGLISH) uses throughout life. In addition, it covers confidence boosting for those students who need an ""extra push.""

I remember times through my education when I thought, ""Why am I learning this stuff?"" This question is repeatedly answered in a variety of ways throughout a graphical environment complete with animation, funny drawings, and sounds. These programs initiate a new style of computer use to help put the interest back in learning. This series is a ""must have"" which you will want to include in your home and school libraries! By starting at the beginning and working together, we can make America great!"

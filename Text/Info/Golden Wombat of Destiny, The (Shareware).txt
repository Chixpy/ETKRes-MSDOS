This is one of the better text adventure games we have seen. The program is able to handle full sentence commands, much in the same way the programs from Infocom. Even though the proghram is a test adventure, it does require a color-graphics adapter. This is due to the ability it has to change the color of the screens and the text to fit the wishes of the user. The quest covered in the game is to discover the Forbidden City of the Great Lost Empire and unearth the mysteries it contains. One thing of note: this program was submitted to the library from our growing pool of authors in England and Europe.

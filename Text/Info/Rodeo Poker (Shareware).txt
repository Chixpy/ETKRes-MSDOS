HOWDY!

Welcome, Tenderfoots, to RODEO POKER a red-blooded all-American version of that popular Rooski game with the little falling blocks. Instead of those little colored blocks we use good ol" American playin" cards, and we play accordin" to the rules of good ol" American Five Card Draw Poker.

In ROPO there are up to four chutes to watch instead of one. As a card is sent into the chute, you "ride" it into groups of five to make a poker hand. The idea is to make good poker hands (jacks or better) to win points and clear the chute. You can even "jump" from one chute to another to make a better hand.

If you"re real good, and a bit lucky, you can play until the cows come home and rack up a really hugamungus score. As a card comes down, you can wrangle it left (LEFT arrow) or right (RIGHT arrow) or even jump to the next chute (UP arrow) to get it into a winnin" hand. The better the hand the bigger the score. When a chute fills up with cards, it"s all over. See if you made the top seven, then try again.

Good luck and straight shootin".

A scrolling clone without sounds. Objects roll off grass and the player, and falling diamonds are not deadly. Monsters come out of dropped eggs, as in Repton. Elements include lava, collectable bombs and dynamite, conveyor belts, and fiery wheels that can even kill monsters. Some levels have diamond generators that must be blocked in order to collect all the diamonds. The MS DOS version"s EGA graphics were later updated to VGA. The Java version is called "WebValley". The download above actually a replica version of the original Dot Valley game, but is almost the same.

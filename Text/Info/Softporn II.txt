In the shadowy dives of Hoboken, New York, a lust-crazed man seals a final tryst with an old flame on the eve of her permanent relocation to far Denmark with her husband.

This is a game that simulates a heterosexual sexual exchange between a man (the player) and a simulated woman.  Taking initial user input for the players" names, personality traits and measurements, it equips them with appropriate adjectives and behaviors and points them in the direction of the player"s garret.

Actual game input overlooks the strengths of a text parser, with viable options including various combinations of vanilla erogenous zones with hands and mouths.  When the arousal levels of both parties is sufficient (both the male being flagged with "hard" status and the woman with "wet" -- indicated by the game via the report command) simulated penetration is allowed.

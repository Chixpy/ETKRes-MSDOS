It"s December, 2042. The world is still recovering from the disastrous consequences of the World War III. Radioactivity has turned many humans into mutants, and the gap between those and the "norms" (non-affected humans) is growing wider. Certain places in the world have retained the feel and the charm of the old times - among those is the Old San Francisco. There, the private investigator Tex Murphy is trying to deal with unemployment, upcoming poverty, and his melancholic mood following his divorce. After solving a simple robbery case, Tex attracts the attention of a mysterious woman who calls herself Countess Renier, and is hired by her to find a missing statuette. Things gradually begin to go wrong in this investigation, and Tex finds himself involved in a confrontation with a powerful and dangerous secret cult...

Under A Killing Moon is the third game in the Tex Murphy series of adventures. It is notable for being the first "pure" adventure game in history that was set in a real 3D world; sprites or digitized images are used instead of 3D models, effectively making it a "2.5D game" visually similar to DOOM. Uncommonly for adventure games, Under A Killing Moon allows full maneuverability. The player can rotate the camera, change the viewing angle, zoom in and out, etc.; it is even possible to look for clues underneath desks, chairs, etc. Other features include an online hint system (that decreases the player"s score with each use), extensive support for additional sound/music devices, and full-motion video technology: cutscenes and much of the dialogue are presented as movies with real actors.

Pumpkins from all over the planet stole Earth"s candles to their home planet. Now, as an axe yielding maniac, you must destroy them and collect the candles back.

This is a simple 2D action game where you must travel through mazes, kill pumpkins and collect candles. Its fame  comes from a newsgroup running joke about a (at the time non-existing) game that would be a Doom killer, but could not generate enough hype due to its horrible sounding name. Reportedly, the developers wrote it in 48 hours to capitalize on the joke.

Smashing Pumpkins into Small Piles of Putrid Debris has the distinction of sharing the title for longest/weirdest game name with the game "Invasion of the Mutant Space Bats of Doom" (no relation other than name-weirdness). It is an interesting blend of action/arcade and puzzle elements, as you attempt to collect candles and, um, smash pumpkins. (No relation to Billy Corgan either heheh). Supposedly this game was written in 48hrs as a joke that started on a Usenet newsgroup (read more at the official Jumal Software webpage, or Mobygames).

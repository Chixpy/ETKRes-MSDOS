Facetrex - puzzle from Soleau Software, the game which followed the motto \u00abfor the creative users\u00bb, and therefore are convex traced the desire to create something original (or at least borrow from themselves, not from someone). Although in relation to that game, you can say that originality is not always in favor of interestingness. playing field size of 12 cells wide and 8 cells in height will be challenging knowing a player for several tens of levels, which can take place freely, in any order and without limiting the number of attempts. Just do not forget that the higher the level of the serial number, the more difficult problem to be solved. To win you need to move situated on the colored faces each in its place, the cell - marked exactly the same person, only gray. Move the person player (walking man) can, approaching them from one side and sending it flying in the opposite direction. The motion will stop only in case of a collision with another person abroad playing field, or in any of the three objects: a green block (can be moved across the field in increments of one cell to control the direction of the portrait), black box (base unit on the field, having the properties of the boundary of the field) or arrow (change direction of flight). Unfortunately, all the above is not enough to sustain interest and variation for all levels, so as not having passed the half of the game, it is already possible to master all the basics of the rules proposed by the developer and start to get bored. But the first half of you I do not disappoint.

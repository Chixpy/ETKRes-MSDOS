In Clif Danger players control the titular protagonist who flies through the galaxy with his spaceship when he receives a call for help by the amazon queen Swihip. Her planet Pleasure 6 got invaded from the rather hostile Glox so it is up to him to save her population. 

The game focuses on the typical run, gun, jump mechanics and as such the plot is not that important. The game offers twenty stages with multiple weapons, where Clif encounters a dozen different enemies and free the amazons from their rather inconvenient position of being bound on plugs.

Spawned from the success of Wing Commander, Strike Commander takes the same style of gameplay and brings it back in time to a much closer future. You lead a rag-tag mercenary fighter squadron, trying to make a living in a dangerous, chaotic world. Pretty and simplified dogfights in your blackmarket-purchased F-16s is supplemented by interactive cutscenes where you converse with your teammates, or go into town to buy new contracts. 

Fly against a very diverse set of aircraft as you find yourself fighting for and against many of the world"s major nations. The concern of managing your team"s armament expeditures and keeping the group in the black adds a side to the game that few simulators have.

Featuring an improved engine over Wing Commander 2, Strike Commander was the first in a series of three games that attempted to take the "Commander" series in a non-sci-fi direction. Ultimately, they failed to capture the same crowd as the WC series did. 

The CD-ROM release of Strike Commander includes the following:

Strike Commander
Strike Commander: Tactical Operations
An additional opening cinematic and menu to choose between these two products
digitized speech for every character, a feature which expands on what was available in the Strike Commander Speech Pack

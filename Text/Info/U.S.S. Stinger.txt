A 3-D combat submarine simulator. The object of the game is to seek out enemy convoys and sink the supply ships and their escorts with your torpedoes and missiles.

Navigation between convoys, ports and environmental hazards, as well as the need to watch your fuel and air supply, add an element of difficulty to the game.

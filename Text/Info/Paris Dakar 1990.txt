The game represents the African part of 12th Paris-Dakar rally route officially sponsored by Tomahawk. Unlike previous Paris-Dakar simulation, African Raiders-01, this game allows to drive a car under control from a cockpit. Drivers are seen to the player, but the view perspective is rather 1st person than 3rd person.

Starting in Tripoli (Lybie) player should race against computer drivers on 6 stages, visiting checkpoints located in Tumu (Lybie), N"Djamena (Tchad), Niamey (Niger), NÃ©ma (Mauritanie), Kayes (Mali), and Dakar (Senegal). The road is marked by rocks on its sides on most stages, and player should keep his car on the road. If player missed a road, he have a limited amount of time to find it again, otherwise he will be penalized. On 2nd and 4th stages, there are no road since the start, and player should reach the finish on his own. The off-road environment is full of rocks, animal corpses, and other debris, and player should not break the car hardly, otherwise he will be penalized also. When checkpoint is reached, the thematic animation sequence is revealed for relaxation purposes.

There are three difficulty levels to select before the start of rally.

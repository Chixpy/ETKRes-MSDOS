"Due to the growing threat of Communist expansion and nuclear proliferation, the U.S.S. Nautilus has been reactivated from the mothball fleet. The Nautilus has been totally refitted with modern equipment, including 16 missile tubes carrying the new Trident-1 nuclear missile, a water-cooled reactor, 2 torpedo tubes armed with MK-48 torpedoes, and totally new submarine quieting, mobility, and self defense systems. For the crew there is a new and separate health room, and an easy access passageway in the fore and aft sections of the boat.

You are a new crewman aboard the Nautilus, and although you have received extensive training before you started your tour of duty, experience is the best teacher, and you will learn much during your stay aboard."

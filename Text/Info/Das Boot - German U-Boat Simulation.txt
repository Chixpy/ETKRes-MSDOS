Das Boot (literally "The Boat") simulates controlling a Type VII U-Boat for the Nazis, in an exact recreation of submarine warfare circa 1941. Both internal and external views are provided, all rendered in full 3D. Allied submarines and surface boats are attacking you from all sides - use your Hydrophone to be aware of forthcoming threads, and use the water as protection from enemy planes. You have 4 styles of torpedo on board - Contact, Acoustic, Looping and Magnetic. All orders are sent in code, to prevent sensitive information reaching Allied forces, with an Enigma code-cracking machine built in to decipher them. There are three skill levels to play at.

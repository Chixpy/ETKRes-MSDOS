Like DaSi before it (and in a similar vein to Taboo before both), PF simulates a spirit board (or Ouija board) for users to entertain themselves with, presenting alternating possibilities of tapping into their subconscious or having their planchette (well, mouse) movements actually propelled by forces from beyond, answering typed questions by spelling out possible responses letter by letter.  Upon the completion of a session, the activities are logged and can be edited for clarity.  No guarantees are made of ghosts in the machine.

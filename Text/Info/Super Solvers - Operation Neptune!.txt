Operation Neptune is a math edutainment title similar to Treasure Mountain, but aimed at older kids. As with other Super Solvers games, Operation Neptune combines platform action with educational puzzles. The game helps build a solid math and problem solving foundation with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, ratios, and percentages. Problem solving hints, calculator, and customization options are all only a keystroke away. Real-life problems such as using area, distance and volume to make measurements help kids see how math can be used in the real world.

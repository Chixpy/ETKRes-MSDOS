If you"re looking for a basic, no-nonsense Tetris game with passable graphics and very appropriate music, check out Fretris. It"s a basic Tetris game with few frills, but it gets te job done. (Note: Use the arrow keys to move pieces and use the J or K keys to rotate blocks. If you thought the in-game music in Fretris sounded familiar, you must"ve played Castlevania IV for the Super NES, that"s where the tune is from. Castlevania IV sure was a sweet game! ^_^)

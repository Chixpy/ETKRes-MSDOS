This is one of the most original puzzle games ever designed, and my most favorite Apple II game.The objective here is to escape from Robotropolis, a dangerous underground robotic city. To escape, you have to program your robots to solve various mind-bending logic puzzles. The game also has one of the best on-line tutorials I"ve ever seen in a game. It is in some ways like the programming puzzle in Sierra"s Castle of Dr. Brain, only ten times more fun-- and difficult. There is IMHO no better way to learn mathematical logic than this game :)

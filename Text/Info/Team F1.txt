Pole Position is another German sports-business simulation. But you\u2019re not manager of a Soccer team \u2013 you manage a Formula 1 Team! Therefore Ascaron has licensed the Teams and Drivers from the 1995 Championship.

At the beginning you can choose an existing Team like Ferrari or Williams or build up your own Team. First of all you have to choose your drivers. The have all individual skills and prices. Michael Schumacher for example is in 1995 a good (not an excellent) but expensive driver. You have to sign up also some other team members \u2013 mechanics, race-manager and the pit-crew. Next you have to negotiate with the support companies. Tires, engine, gearing \u2013 all these things you need for your race-car. You also need some sponsors \u2013 you can also negotiate with these guys.

At the racing weekend you have to adjust your car to the track. The race was presented in a nice TV-oriented 3D graphic. At this time you can only keep your fingers crossed.

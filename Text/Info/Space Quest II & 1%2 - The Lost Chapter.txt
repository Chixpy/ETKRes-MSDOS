This before-unknown-sequel in the Space Quest Saga begins with Roger Wilco, still floating around aimlessly in space after defeating Vohaul in SQ2. After who-knows-how-long drifting in space, a strange force slams into Roger\u2019s escape vessel which causes it to travel close to an unknown planet. Right after passing the planet, the escape pod is trapped by the planet\u2019s gravitational pull and starts a rapidly descent to the planet\u2019s surface. The escape pod crash-lands but is relatively undamaged. The crash has trigged the release of the sleepchamber in which Roger is snoozing away. He soon wakes up, to find himself still inside the escape pod, and quite blonde too! Roger soon starts to survey his surroundings, finding that he has crashed onto a heavily vegetated planet. Here, the adventure starts.

Wanna" hear more? You"ve been chosen as an ambassador.

Ambassador? What the ____ do they think they"re doing? These alien things are coming with guns and who knows what else to destroy the place. Ambassador? More like a blimmin" leader of a suicide trek into the enemy filled void. Space is dangerous "nough without any aliens!

Well, you take the most powerful ship on Venus and prepare for trouble....."

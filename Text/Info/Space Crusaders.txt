Classic remake of the old \u2018Space Invaders\u2019 game using many of the original elements but offering better sound, graphics and animation.

Space Crusaders is an excellent remake of the old "Space Invaders" classic which retains much of the charm of the original but uses enhanced sound, graphics and animation.

The credits are a bit long though some of the animation is excellent. Just press the spacebar if you want it to hurry it up a bit.

The game features multi-levels (we didn"t go through to the end so we don"t know how many and the author doesn"t say) and a high score.

Sounds are good and require SoundBlaster compatibility.

Very playable game.

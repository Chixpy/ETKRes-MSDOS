One of the most unique games ever made, To Serve and To Protect places you in command of a police department in a crime ridden city.Like a real police chief (and subordinate commanding officers), the game lets you control virtually all aspects of the police force including budgeting, personnel management, dispatching, taxing, and building new buildings for the department. In addition to dispatching existing vehicles to crime scenes and arrange their patrol patterns, you can also purchase new police vehicles (2 types in the shareware version and 6 in the registered) to add to your fleet. You can investigate crimes, arrest criminals, and plan assaults on criminal locations. 

One of the most fun features of the game is that it allows you to manage different kinds of the police officers, and your decisions really have an impact in the game. Put too few patrol officers on the job, for example, and you can expect to see a rise in accidents. Hire too few informers, and you will hear less tips on the next big heist. Putting expensive detectives on your payroll is also crucial to apprehend criminals before they commit too many crimes. TSTP supports high resolution Sim City-style graphics. The gameplay is fun, and feels a lot like Crime Fighter except you are fighting on the side of good this time around ;) 

With a plethora of features, a unique premise, and a dynamic gameworld -- a huge city bustling with cars and events, TSTP is one quality shareware game that is well worth your time, especially if you enjoy reality-based micromanagement simulations. This download is the very rare registered version 1.1, thanks to Matt :)

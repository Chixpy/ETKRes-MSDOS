Counter Action is a real-time strategy released when, due to success of Command & Conquer, many clones started to appear. What really differs this game from almost all RTS-titles of that time is its setting. Game actions take place in World War 2 on the East front. Player can take command over both Russian or German armies with separate campaigns and 14 missions for each side.

Another feature of Counter Action is an absence of macromanagement, i.e. there"s no building/resource gathering involved in the game. One will only need to control his forces on a battlefield. However, in terms of gameplay CA is still very close to Command & Conquer, with its famous "tank rush" tactic.

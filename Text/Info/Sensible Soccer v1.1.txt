With the original Sensible Soccer having sold hugely, this updated version was released some months later (and then used as the basis for the later console versions). The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. 

The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one \u2018professional foul\u2019 (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.

In fact, this football game - it"s a little upgrade of the original Sensible Soccer , which recaps updated in relation to the realities of 1992-1993 (yes, despite poluyumoristichesky appearance - all the players and teams in the game are real.) But in fact, the changes much more And chief among them - to add to the game yellow and red cards, acting in the same way as in real life. The main game modes are pretty standard, but is available, for example, qualified for the 1994 World Cup. We must also note the improvement of game as a goalkeeper all teams. graphically in the game may seem to some unusual: the picture here for a time, very high quality, but for the field, we see a bird"s eye, and all the figures drawn players are very, very small (but can be seen almost all over the field). The verdict - very good sports video game, in fact gave rise to a whole series of glorious, Radovan players for several years.

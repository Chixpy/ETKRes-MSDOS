A solid 3D version of Tic Tac Toe, Cubic features a strong AI, 2-player mode, and a lot of "extras" that suggest high production value, such as complete on-line rules, difficulty levels, and more.The idea is simple: make a row of O"s or X"s in any direction, and prevent the opponent from doing same. There"s not much more to say about the game, but that"s because it does what all good puzzle games do: presents an enjoyable diversion with simple rules that are hard to master. Perfect to while away a few minutes at a time when you"re stumped at some bigger puzzlers. Thumbs up!

Clash of Steel: World War II, Europe 1939-45 is a strategic board game were you take control of the Axis or the Allied forces. As axis leader you must conquest all Europe and North Africa prior January 1946 to win the game at 100%. If you are not eradicated prior this date you win to, but the allied nations still are live and this is not your goal. As Allied you must eradicate the Axis terror as quickly as you could. 

In 1995, SSI released an upgrade to the game, Clash of Steel FE. The title screen called the game "Clash of Steel II - Future Edition", with the strap line "or What is after World War III?". The scenarios featured were exactly the same as those in the original game, except that they were all dated in the 21st century rather than the 20th century. Despite this misleading title and dating, though, the game is not set in some future-themed scenario. It is essentially the same game as the original, but with some major bug fixes and AI enhancements (for example, diplomacy could be used to more effectively sway a battle, and the opening menu notes that it is a version 2 of the original game). Clash of Steel FE was more a glorified patch rather than a new game and fans regarded that the "FE" stood more for "Finished Edition"!

Kurtan is an old clone of Sokoban, developed by a joint US-Georgian (former USSR) venture. 

The game was widely circulated in the post-Soviet space. It comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by moving all the randomly placed crates into their target spots. Some control issues exist where a single keystroke would cause the player character to move several spaces instead of one, making the game exceedingly challenging. 

The main character has been replaced with a stereotypical Georgian loader, and maze designs are slightly different than in the original. The game uses the 16 color high-res 640x350 EGA mode.

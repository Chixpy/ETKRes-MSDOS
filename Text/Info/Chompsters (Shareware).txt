A very fun Pacman type game that expands on the original Pacman idea by adding different characters (Pacmen?) to play, as well as having varied, large levels and ghosts with individual personalities that talk to you between levels. Your Pacman can also jump and use new special items. It"s all very well done, and it"s fun to play, as well. (Note: Although I was unable to get a screenshot of this game, it does look VERY good. ^_^)

The only RPG ever published by QQP, Red Crystal is a very kind of RPG that can best be described as RPG meets strategy-- similar to Omnitrend"s Paladin and Sierra"s Birthright, your goal is to maximize your hero"s fame by sending him/her to different quests that may or may not be part of the overall plot of the game (which, in this case, is your typical "kill-the-evil-lord" story).It has its moments, but the whole is unfortunately less than the sum of its parts here because neither the strategy nor the RPG portion truly stands out. Worth a look if you are interested in seeing tactical elements in RPGs, though. Another innovative feature here is that two players can play the game simultaneously.

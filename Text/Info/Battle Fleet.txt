Battle Fleet is a Battleship clone wherein you must place your five naval vessels on a grid while your computer or friend via modem does the same. After all the ships are placed you can now take turns trying to determine the location of each other"s fleet and sinking them by taking well thought-out shots at the enemy grid. If you"ve placed a hit you will be notified of it on your enemy grid and can now try and guess which way the enemy ship is placed and sink them. Hence, the rules of the game are identical to the Milton Bradley game. The only differences are the grid numbering and some ship names.

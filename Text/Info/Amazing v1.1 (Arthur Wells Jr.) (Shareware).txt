Amazing is a game in which you must move your marker through mazes to the goal. The mazes, which are never the same, get more difficult the better you do. If you complete eight mazes you move to a higher rank in which the game becomes more difficult. Along the way you get points for completing a maze, lose points if you don"t, and get extra markers for reaching certain point levels.

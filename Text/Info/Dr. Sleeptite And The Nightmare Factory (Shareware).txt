"Have you ever felt the rush of 50,000 volts as an electric shock jolts through your body? Have you ever been tormented by angry pillows in the middle of the night? Have you ever fallen off a six story platform and lived to tell about it? Not many people have, but you will... So put on your jogging shoes and say goodbye to your next of kin, because you have an appointment with the doctor!

Welcome to Dr. Sleeptite And The Nightmare Factory.

Deep in the heart of the Mojave Desert, the mad Dr. Sleeptite has been hard at work developing a machine that creates nightmares. No one knows where the doctor is, but his automated underground complex still continues to produce its fiendish product.

Your job (as Restless Ralph Runabout) is to traverse six levels of Dr. Sleeptite"s Nightmare Factory, to destroy his Nightmare Capsules, and attempt to shutdown his Dream Machine. Sound easy? Not when you"re being chased about by the doctor"s first invention: Killer Pillows!"

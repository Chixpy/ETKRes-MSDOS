One of the more obscure releases from Capstone, and for good reason, Exotic Car Showroom is an average application that showcases a few car makes, without any "game" element.Unlike Ford Simulator that lets you test drive new Ford models in a first-person perspective sim, Exotic Car Showroom is just a database of a few cars that you can view statistics on, no more, no less. If you are interested in what new cars were made around 1991-1992, then you might find a few minutes" worth of enjoyment from another average release from Capstone, the "nadir" of computer gaming. Otherwise, you can help save our bandwidth by browsing on-line car archives instead ;)

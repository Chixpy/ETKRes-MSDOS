A stock implementation of the Tetris falling-block puzzle (whose goal is to "fill" entire empty lines with irregularly-shaped segments) rendered in textmode graphics, intended for keyboard-driven play over modem as a BBS door game, this limited but effective version can also be played locally.  The unregistered version features only three levels, but all hold true to the basic Tetris premises.

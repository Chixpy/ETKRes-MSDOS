The galactic government has sent you - and others - in to rescue some hostages from alien invaders. You are sent in with an aircraft and a personal carrier that is used as a base to repair and re-arm your craft.

Your aim is to collect hostages - using a pod for your craft you must pick up from a factory first, steal them from your opponent bounty hunters, and even to kill hostages to make sure you have more than your opponent bounty hunter - at least 75% of the total. All this while avoiding or fighting the different types of aliens that have taken the hostages in the first place. You can also shoot your opponents craft.

You"re limited to fairly low flying planetary air movement in your aircraft. There"s a choice of weapons, 3 of which you can take with you at any time, and a choice of pods you can buy which are used to pick up the hostages.

Take turns trying to place five stones in a row or, if that fails, capture five pairs of your opponents stones between your stones in the board game Pente. While Pente plays mostly like a clone of Gomoku or Five-In-A-Row the main difference would have to be the capturing and avoiding capture of five pairs of stones. The stones are placed anywhere in an intersection on the board and lines can be made horizontally, vertically or diagonally to win or capture. The game options are to play against the computer or take turns playing against another player. There is also an option to adjust the colours of the game board and stones.

A fantasy-horror themed pinball game from China, similar to Naxat Soft"s Dragon"s Fury. The story involves an evil wizard defeating and trapping two good ones after an epic battle.

The game is controlled by the two Shift keys with Enter used to launch the ball. The ball can be shot inside the dragon to enter a bonus stage to free the trapped good wizard.

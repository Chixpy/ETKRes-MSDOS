America Adventure is another solid title in Knowledge Adventure"s somewhat popular series based on Knowledge Adventure engine.In this title, you will learn about the geography, history, and general trivia involving the United States. In addition to a decent database that is packed with interesting factoids, America Adventure also includes a number of mini-games such as guess the capital city - none of which is particularly engaging, however. 

If you have tried any other title in this series, you will be familiar with the interface. A photo screen occupies the right half of the screen, while the information box, the map, and menu icons lined up around it. You use the map and accompanying timeline to choose the time period and location in the USA you want to read about, and each photo has a number of "hot spots" you can click on to bring up related subjects. All in all, a decent title that offers enough trivia about the USA to occupy you for a while, although the games could be much better and the database more comprehensive.

One of the plethora of puzzle type games released by Soleau Software, Sea Run has many similarities to the classic Pipeline game, or for that matter Soleau"s own Ant Run or Oilcap games. The task here is to rotate different arrows to keep the ship moving on the board. I found this game tougher than Ant Run and other similar games so if you"re looking for an additional challenge you may want to try this. EGA graphics and basic sound effects.

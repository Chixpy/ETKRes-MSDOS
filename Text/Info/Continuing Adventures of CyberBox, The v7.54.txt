A challenging puzzle where the object is to escape from each of 15 rooms, ideally as efficiently as you can, by pushing and pulling boxes around; Sokoban on steroids! DOS.

CyberBox is a fun puzzle where the object is to move boxes around so you can access the next level (15 in all plus a level editor).

Like Sokoban on steroids, CyberBox is a challenging game with six styles of boxes, each with its own characteristics. Many boxes are mono-directional, some will follow you like a dog, others seems to have a mind of their own (they don"t, they are simply following the rules of the game). Great fun!

This DOS game only requires a VGA monitor and the lack of colors (16 only, as with any VGA game) means that the screen looks a little bland.

Don"t worry about looks though, because within a few minutes you"ll be so involved in trying to solve the various puzzles (each level is different, of course) that you won"t care. Still, we would love to see a Windows version of this game, if only to offer better graphics and a fuller color palette.

Don"t expect to solve these puzzles in a few minutes and the "Save game" option should get well used as you get called away for other things \u2013 like sleeping.

Apart from the clunky DOS interface, we loved CyberBox!

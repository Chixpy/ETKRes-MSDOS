For fans of Kroz and ZZT comes a textmode dungeon romp even busier and more abstract!  You play a wizard who has ventured into caverns in pursuit of greatness -- as measured in the form of loot, here broken down into gold, gems and orbs.  You"re up against seven different types of enemies, each with different behaviors and attack types, but to defend yourself (well, to protect you during your invasion of their home 8) you have your trusty magik staff at your disposal, which besides making a good club allows you to cast spells, including the missile attack Fireball, the area-effect Abiotic Blast, and Teleport.  Use them sparingly, though, as each spell consumes one scroll, and though you can find more in the dungeon, once you consume them all you"re left with nothing but your directional staff-swings (attacking with the arrow keys while moving with the keypad) to hold the monsters at bay.  When you"re satisfied with your ill-gotten loot, find the warp out and enter it to the next randomly-generated level.

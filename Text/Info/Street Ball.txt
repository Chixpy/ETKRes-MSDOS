Street ball is an Arcade/Puzzle game where your goal is to guide a bouncing ball through a maze collecting treasures and avoiding obstacles.  Your ball moves back and forth on wires until you release it, at which point it bounces around the maze until it hits another wire.  It has a limited number of "hit points" so you must time your releases to steer the ball over treasures while avoiding laser cannons and evil black "zombie" balls.  Once you have obtained the correct numbers and types of treasures, an exit opens which takes you to the next of the 20 mazes.

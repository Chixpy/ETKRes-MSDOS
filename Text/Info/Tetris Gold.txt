Tetris Gold was a CD-ROM released by Spectrum HoloByte in 1993 containing all of the Tetris games and spinoffs they ever made: Tetris, Super Tetris, Tetris Classic, Wordtris, Faces...Tris III, Welltris, and a prototype version of Tetris.

Because it was a CD, it included versions for DOS (All 7), Windows (Tetris Classic and Super Tetris only) and Macintosh (All but Tetris Classic and the prototyppe version, color and B&W versions included!). The CD also included a 10-minute video interview with Alexey Pajitnov, creator of Tetris.

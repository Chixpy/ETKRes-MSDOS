Crayon Box has a little bit of everything for your little ones. First, it is a coloring and sketch book with over 450 different colors and patterns that can be used to paint predrawn pictures, or drawings that the child creates. In addition, Crayon Box tests the child"s math, counting, and color identification skills. The math feature displays large 1 high numbers and prompts the child for answers. 10 different skill levels from easy (2+3=?) to difficult (144/12=?). The counting and color identification feature displays a screen of randomly numbered and randomly colored marbles. The child must identify and count the number of each group when prompted. Spiral designs can also be created which can be painted on the screen. To increase memory skills, a Concentration style puzzle is available where the child must correctly match picture tiles in pairs. And lastly, for those older ones, a United States game where the child must point to the correct state when prompted. Attractive user interface (with large colorful point and click buttons) makes Crayon Box simple and fun to use.

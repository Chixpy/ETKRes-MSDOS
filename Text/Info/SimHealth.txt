SimHealth is one of the more interesting and novel ideas to become a game in the famed "Sim" series. It may be stretching it a bit to call it a game, given the detailed level of the simulation and its serious subject matter: the debate in the summer of 1994 over what kind of health care system the United States should have. 

The player gets the usual godlike power, being able to choose what proposals to adopt and even what assumptions should be in the underlying mathematical models (an especially good thing, since many of the models turned out to be so very wrong).

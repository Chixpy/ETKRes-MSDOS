This game is odd. The premise is that you have a limited amount of time (30 minutes) to reach the control room of the nuclear reactor. The gameplay is strange. It involves avoiding multiple pits of water, and occationally robot guards. You can jump (only while running) and pick up items (once in awhile, out of grates on the ground). It"s unique, that"s for sure, but I can"t say I found it very entertaining. (Be sure to check JOGGER.DOC for full instructions including what various keys do ... as well as more weirdness.)

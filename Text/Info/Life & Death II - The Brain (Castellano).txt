The Brain follows the same premise as its predecessor Life & Death, wherein the player controls an up-and-coming surgeon who must perform simulated surgery on patients with varying problems. The sequel focuses on the brain, whereas the first game focused on the abdomen.  

The graphics and gameplay have been improved from the first game, but, other than the new patient cases, it plays more or less the same.

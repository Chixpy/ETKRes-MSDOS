Your mission is to nuke all planets in the HPCF system. Each is surrounded by a mine field, and your ship can withstand the impact of 10 of them (or a substantially less number of impacts with the Magical Light Blue Force Field of Lazy Programming). Shields recharge between planets, of which there are n + 1, where n is the planet you are currently in orbit around.

Planets cause gravity, and gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration, so buckle your seat belt.

Press space to turn the other direction (but your maneuverability isn"t the best anyway....).

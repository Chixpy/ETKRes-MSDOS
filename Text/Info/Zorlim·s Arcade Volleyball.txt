Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball is a cute game. It is not something that a big-name company poured millions of dollars into, but it is fun and entertaining. It probably did not win any awards in 1995, and it probably was not featured in any gamers" magazines. Still, Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball has a certain charm.

The graphics in Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball are simple but very effective. The game is basically an overblown version of Pong. Gamers must note any effort into the graphic quality of the game. The three-legged volleyballing aliens are cute but not goofy, and the sand volleyball court is fairly detailed but not overdone. The ball is very detailed. It looks like a volleyball and rotates during volleys. Simplicity is the word that hits you in the face when you look at the graphics in Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball.

The sound effects and music in Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball are hokey, but not annoying. Again, simplicity is the rule. You can turn off both music and sound effects easily if they get on your nerves.

Game play is extremely fun. The only big problem is the fact that both players must use the same keyboard. The controls are set far enough apart for each player that bumping is kept to a minimum. To get the most out of this game, practice is essential. The ball tends to bounce in strange ways. Players must maintain their composures if they are to reset themselves after the ball takes a weird bounce.

Zorlim"s Arcade Volleyball is very fun. It has the same appeal as Pong did in the 1970s. Perhaps nostalgia plays a role in my enjoyment of it, so younger players might not be so excited. My only real complaint is that there is no one-player support. It would be enjoyable to play alone now and then.

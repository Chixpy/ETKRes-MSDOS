"Somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumoured that some who enter are never seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave. This program will be your eyes and hands.

This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther at Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Lab, and derives from the roll playing game ""Dungeons and Dragons"". Most of the features of the current program were added by Don Woods. The current version was done by Bob Supnik. This version was implemented on the IBM-PC (and compatibles) by Kevin Black."

A straightforward Amidar clone, Gapper adds a little twist, acknowledged in its name.  As in its predecessors, the goal here is to change the colour of a series of lines (here in a straight grid pattern of increasing complexity) by traversing all of them -- a dotless Pac-Man or 2D Q-bert, if you will.  The player"s trail-leaving sprite, the Gapper, is ever pursued by the Seeker, a little enemy that finds the most effective route to intercept the player, follows it, meets up and deducts a life.  In order to throw the Seeker off the trail, the Gapper has the option of producing a temporary "gap" in its trail, impassable by either of them until it expires.

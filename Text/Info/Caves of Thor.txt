Caves of Thor is an extremely interesting and oddly playable ASCII game released early in Apogee"s existance, shortly after the Kroz series of games. Programmed by Todd Replogle (who later went on to be lead programmer on all of the Duke Nukem games), Caves was Apogee"s first game release that was coded by an outside author. The game itself is an extremely simple action/adventure game that is still playable and fun. This game was recently re-released by 3D Realms (formerly Apogee software) as freeware, so this is the full version of this game.

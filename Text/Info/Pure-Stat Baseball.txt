Rare in all senses of baseball simulator, first, he"s just a very old (in fact - one of the first), and second - this is one of the rarest games for the PC, since that game came out somewhere else, except on machines Commodore and Apple, information and really do not find it. The game features all the teams of the American League season in 1985, and eight teams from the past (alas, the author of the description is not a great expert on the history of baseball, so that the detailed information in this regard difficult). In addition to the ability to manage the matches, the game contains a significant managerial element: you can sell, buy or trade players to create their own team and even their own league. Of course, to play the game, as in any other baseball simulator, only in the event that you at least know a little bit of this rule is not very popular in our sport. But the game has a kind of mode, "demonstration", when both teams are playing for your computer, and you just watch. Also, the game differs a great "adjustability": you can choose not only the team but the concrete stadium, a set of conditions, the future match and so on. Perspective view - isometric. There are several graphics modes, but the most "beautiful" of them - four-color CGA-palette. Figures athletes is not quite small, but very legible conditional and must unfortunately admit that in terms of graphics DOS-version they loose versions from other platforms. However, by itself this baseball simulator quite cute, and most importantly - it was just another unfathomable rarity, which is currently only available on our website and nowhere else.

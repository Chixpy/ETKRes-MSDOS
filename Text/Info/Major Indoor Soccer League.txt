The official game of the MISL, this game allows you to create an expansion team and build it into a championship franchise. You can trade and create players, modify team rosters, and train players for the season. Team stats are kept for 9 seasons, and the game offers the ability to coach, GM, play or all 3.

Most likely, the rarest football game on PC, while still miraculously resurrected to life. At the it"s all pretty standard - create a team (though generally the game seems to be released on a license), are participating in the championship, players can exchange ( and on the field, and in general), and even create their own, as well as to train them, improving their performance (statistics of players retained for nine seasons). Graphically looks pretty good, although, of course, modelki players (albeit rather large) partially blurred . All in all - you can play, but a "highlight" in the game, so it will be of interest primarily to collectors or the biggest lovers of football.

Compete in a 10-race motocross season with some of the world"s best riders.  Trick out your bike by adjusting the fork angle, tire pressure, engine dynamics, suspension, and gear ratio to get the best possible performace.  (Different bike configurations are needed to be successful on different tracks.)  

Racing dynamics are also valid: Your bike can stall, get its wheel or fork bent out of shape, etc.  You also have complete control over squaring off (negotiating a corner), the mastery of which is required to do well in the game.

NOTA: Necesita joystick, real o emulado, para funcionar correctamente.

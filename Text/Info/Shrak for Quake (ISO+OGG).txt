A "Quake total conversion", this game pretty much only has the double-barreled shotgun and the engine to relate it to id"s Quake, but what the heck.

You have 19 new levels packed with completely new enemies to fight through. New weapons include uzis, a foe-to-friend converter, an inflator gun and an utility belt that includes flares, plastique, and grappling hooks.

Multiplayer choices include standard deathmatch, as well as capture the flag.

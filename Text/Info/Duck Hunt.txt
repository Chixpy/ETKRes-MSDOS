Loosely inspired by Duck Hunt for the NES, for lack of a light gun this game instead demands an itchy trigger finger on the space bar.  You play a little armed ASCII-man in the bottom centre of the screen; a series of rude birds will fly above you, and you must fire your shot timed such that the bullet"s trajectory will intercept that of the bird.  Too late, and the duck will insult you.  Since you can only shoot straight up, this amounts to mentally anticipating how soon the duck will fly directly overhead, and subtracting the time it takes for your bullet to reach the duck"s height.  Gameplay continues until the hunter runs out of bullets.

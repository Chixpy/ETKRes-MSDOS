Another completely unknown Spanish game, which has no mention of the Internet. By genre - combat platformer. You take on the role of certain Asian fighter in the style of Bruce Lee, who (apparently) was in a huge palace, filled to overflowing by hostile fighters, and all they need to win. In game just two steps: simultaneous jump and kick and likeness "dive". Enemies are many: some are totally indistinguishable from the hero and dressed in white, some like a little less dense and are light crimson kimono, but more agile. Stay somewhere positively not, because the enemies always appear out of nowhere and chase you. The hero just five points, "life", and every missed punch takes one of them (although sometimes it turns out that we got, but the point is somehow not removed). To make up life points to collect bonuses in the form of the principal symbol of Taoism, but to get even one point they have to take a few. The same button is responsible for both the "jump-punch" and a simple jump, as jumping over all ladders and platforms there will be enough. graphics in the game is pretty nice and bright, although the characters, unlike backgrounds, drawing great clarity can not boast. Overall, not a very difficult (in comparison with other Spanish old games) thing, but still very dynamic and does not give a second to relax. And, of course, a valuable collector"s item. PS: The game is made \u200b\u200bin Spain, so it is in Spanish (there is only text in the menu), and its management is different from the English-language games: move left - O, move to the right - P, jump or Airstrike - Q, pochard - A.

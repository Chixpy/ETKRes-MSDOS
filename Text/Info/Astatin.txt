Unusual design (externally) puzzle, the essence of which is formally quite simple: the screen is divided into two parts, each of which is a field of cells, the right side shows the image that you want to lay tiles on the left, placing them there in the cell. But in fact, such a trivial problem only seems simple. There are five types of tiles, they differ in the color (gold, silver, gray, pink, purple) and a picture of them. The relationship with the tiles as follows: if two golden tiles touching one face (face it - contact angle does not count), then one of them (the one that was put earlier) turns to blue when the two blue - then the gray, and so on. In this case, the sheer number of tiles that you can use is not limited, and all the "new" tile on the field - always gold, but you do nothing to prevent or move somewhere already laid tiles (with, for example, tiles, blue, and became lost contact with golden tiles, through which it became blue, does not change its color), or completely remove them from the field. main difficulty the game - a cruel restriction on time of each round, decorated in almost eerie form screen games divides the image similarity snakes ( or a dragon?) top view, and inside it is slowly disappearing chain links (!) as they all disappear - the game will be played (but will be allowed to start playing again from losing levels). With each new level patterns that need to be collected from the tiles, more complex, and subsequently increase significantly and the size of the field, so that the game - the real hardcore puzzle, while designed in a very non-standard for the genre of "dark" and sinister scheme. It is highly recommended (also due to the huge rarity) all fans really incredibly complex and challenging the player to intelligent computer entertainment that require fast response.

"MEL ODIUS GOES SIX STRING SEARCHIN" is an animated, 3-D graphic adventure in which you play the role of Mel Odius, an up-and-coming young guitarist who is about to get that big break. He has a small problem, though. The problem is that his guitar has been stolen!

Your objective is to help Mel find his guitar. You must wander around town in search of his precious guitar, and you must find it tonight because his big showcase for the record executives is the next morning. As you move about town, you will find a variety of objects which will help you in your quest. You will also meet some interesting characters in the various establishments throughout the small town. Some will help; others will ignore you. You must deal with all these people, however, since someone must know who stole your guitar!

The game uses VGA graphics (the scenes are only 16-color but they were drawn using a VGA palette so they will not work in EGA). It is strongly recommended that you play the game from your hard disk. It requires 640K and an IBM-PC or comp. You interact with the game by typing in commands such as GET BRICK, TALK BUM, etc. The enclosed instructions document will assist you. Please take the time to read it before you start. And most of all, enjoy the game. It was created for your enjoyment! The game is not easy, though.

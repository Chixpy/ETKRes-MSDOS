"Pai Gow Poker combines the elements of the ancient Chinese game of Pai Gow and the American game of Poker. It is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards plus a joker. The joker can be used only as an ace or to complete a straight, a flush or a straight flush.

Each player is dealt seven cards face down, which the player arranges to make two poker hands: a two-card hand and a five-card hand. The player must always be sure that the five-card hand beats the two-card hand. Any player"s hand that is set incorrectly is a foul hand and becomes an automatic loser. The two-card hand is called the Low or Front hand and the five-card hand is called the High or Back hand. The Low hand is not played as Lowball poker. The player should not associate the term Low hand with low poker. Both hands are played high. One hand just happens to hold two cards.

The object of the game is to beat the banking hand. In most cases the banking hand is the casino, but the player"s may bank the game also. In order for the player to win his or her bet, the player"s High and Low hand must beat the bankers High and Low hand. IE: Players winning both High and Low hands are winners. Players winning either High or Low hands are ties or pushes. Players losing both High and Low hands are losers. Neither the house bank or player bank may foul their hand. In the event a banker fouls a hand, the hand is reset according to the house hand rules. If a player fouls a hand, it"s an automatic loser.

The house collects a 5% commission on all winning hands. If a player is banking, that player pays the 5% commission only if player shows a profit."

Sierra"s adventure games have always included little arcade sequences that, for the most part, offer a fun diversion from puzzles at hand.Crazy Nick"s Picks games are collections of these games-within-a-game with a budget price (less than $6). With the exception of King Graham"s Board Game Challenge, they are exact reproductions. My favorites are nine men morris in Robin Hood"s and Ms. Astro Chicken from Roger Wilco"s.

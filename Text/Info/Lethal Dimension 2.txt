In Lethal Dimension I, Sir Logan defeated a demon that was threatening his dimension by traveling through other dimensions to gather pendants. These were not just any pendants, but one that if he gathered all three of them, he would be able to challenge him. But this time, he must collect four pendants. And he has a trick he used against him. He posessed the Blue Ninja, but not fully. Just enough to where his want to defeat Logan made him do terrible things. But onto the real story. Logan thought that one day he heard a voice in his head that he could of sworn was the Hellish Demond"s, so he went to his house so that he could get into the dimensions to investigate. But when he went to open the door, the blue ninja attacked him, and they fought. Sir Logan easily won, but Blue Ninja used magic on the door so it was closed and no one could get into it. Then he told Logan that he did it becouse he could teleport into the dimensions and Logan can"t, so he thinks that he would be able to defeated the Hellish Demon and get credit for it. He disappears. Then Logan hurried over to the master"s dojo. (He thought that the master would be able to get the lock open.) But the master knew that the Hellish Demon was much stronger and tested Logan in a battle. The master thought that he needed a helper, and sends his only student that can teleport, Neon, along with him.

"Some day in the future

The silence was broken vividly by loud static, and then a low voice.

""Chara 4........"" 

Someone sat erect and began to listen.

""Chara 4.....Chara 4.......Is anyone there? Hello.......... I"m hailing the planet Chara 4 .......Is anyone there?"" 

""This is Chara 4. Who hails the planet Charanaphan?"" 

""I need to speak with someone in charge of your military..."" 

Quiet hysteria hung over the mechanical world of Chara 4. A nervousness hung about each and every one of the world"s intelligent machines. In one particular place, one large group of Orb"s, as they are popularly described by their alien allies, waited with the most acute panic anywhere to be found. Many beings talked or whispered, pretended to joke, or just hung about the hall in silence.

It was then that a fairly important Orb rolled into the hall and collected the silent attention of the entire group which waited. Another Orb followed behind and waited to one side.

""One of you will be selected to either save our world or debunk a hoax. Either way, it will be one of you, who have been noticed for some personal valor or special strengths."" 

The Orb paused.

""Apparently, some scavenger alien has found himself on a abandoned world where the old machines seem to still be in operation. According to he, the old mainframe computer has selected us (for some unknown reason) as a threat to those who no longer live there."" 

""It, again according to he, is constructing, by process of energy-to-matter conversion, weaponry to launch at us, and while we are confident we could fend off such a strike, the computer could send more. We need to strike this system down at its heart and end this threat."" 

The Orb swiveled to regard the second Orb who had entered with him. He turned back to the crowd.

""Our scientist fellow here, a researcher of our aggressor, has received some information from a probe he sent there, as well as depositing some of our most potent weaponry. This information has been placed in the ship that will transport you to the planet, but the weapons have been noticed and captured by the enemy. When you land, you"ll need to find them to use "em, fighting your way, apparently, through many multitudes of small creatures and large and trained or bred creatures. In the cities you will meet more advanced automated adversaries, and traps, no doubt, as well."" 

After several weeks of tests one Orb had been selected to penetrate the defenses of the derelict world. He is You! Your ship will proceed to a home-made transport warp and within a minute you will be closing in on the enemy world below. Good Luck. "

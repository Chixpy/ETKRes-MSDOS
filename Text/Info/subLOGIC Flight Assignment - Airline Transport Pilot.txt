Airline Transport Pilot is an advanced simulator from subLOGIC, that allows you to fly airliners, such as Boeing 737, 747, 767 or Airbus A320. The graphics engine was improved, with two dozen different airports across the entire continental US, some buildings in major cities, and radio beacons all across the country. And for the first time in flight sim history, Air Traffic Control. The AI ATC will actually give you directions!

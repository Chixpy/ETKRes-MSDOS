Spell Castle is an educational game designed to improve spelling and typing skills. During the game, words will appear from the top of a castle and float downwards. You need to type in the words correctly before they reach the bottom of the screen and destroy your drawbridge. There are several difficulty levels you can choose from; the words can be anywhere from three to nine letters long, and you can optionally have the words jumbled to make figuring them out more difficult. Included is a list of approximately 6000 words, or you can create your own word list.

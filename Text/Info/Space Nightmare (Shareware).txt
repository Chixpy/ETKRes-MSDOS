A rare EGA shoot-em-up game, Space Nightmare is pretty well made, including multiple ships you can select, well drawn & smooth-scrolling graphics, and adequate sound effects. There is of course no plot to speak of, but it doesn"t really need a storyline: Just shoot everything in sight, collect powerups, and try not to die. Not nearly as hectic as some shooting games, Space Nightmare plays well and probably won"t prove to be overly taxing.

Crashing your spaceship on a strange planet and formulating some sort of escape plan is a longstanding convention in science fiction literature, film and games.  This game begins with Jacaranda Jim"s spaceship crashing on Ibberspleen IV and there the conventions evaporate: his antagonists?  A fleet of homicidal beechwood armchairs.  It"s all right, though -- with your constant companion Alan the Gribbley and the assistance of Mavis, a cow, you will help Jim navigate Ibberspleen"s strangely familiar village marketplace, hunting for legendary treasure and, ultimately, a return to outer space.

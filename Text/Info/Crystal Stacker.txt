Crystal Stacker is a falling bricks puzzle based off "Columns" where you have to match up the colors to get groups of 3 so that the blocks disappear.

It features one or two players, choice of additional themes (from author"s site), theme editor available, music, etc.

Crystal Stacker is a great game to play. You have to match up the colored blocks horizontally, vertically or diagonally and you can change the position of the colors on the columns as they fall.

What seems easy at first becomes more and more addictive as you play. Matched colored blocks explode off the screen (with good animated graphics) and the sound effects and music are excellent.

We were most impressed with Crystal Stacker. It is a fun game that can be played on any computer from a 486 and up. It is very suitable for Windows through the typically clunky graphics did detract slightly from the game.

If you like Tetris, Columns, or similar one or two-player puzzles you will love Crystal Stacker.

Try it!

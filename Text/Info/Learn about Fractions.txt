Learn about Fractions is a good educational title by Compedia, part of its excellent "Top Class" series.Like other Top Class titles, Learn about Fractions offers a series of multiple-choice quizzes. Although the scope of the program is limited to fractions, it is nonetheless a solid title that teaches most of what you need to know about fractions - although for some people it may be too much math in one evening ;) Recommended, especially to kids who are beginning to learn more advanced algebra than simple arithmetic.

Other than the story, Robomaze III has nothing to do with Robomaze II. After defeating the Mad Scientist in The Tower, the robotic hero took a helicopter to The Dome, but forgot its gun! Where Robomaze II was a platformer and shooter, Robomaze III is an adventure RPG. I"ll just come out and say it: Robomaze III is The Legend of Zelda for DOS. Your character moves around an overworld filled with bad guys, gets hints from wisemen in caves, finds secret entrances under trees, gains the ability to smash rocks, acquires medieval weapons like swords, axes, and bow and arrows, and adds hearts to his health meter so that he can take more hits. The hearts even empty half a heart at a time! So, while the graphics and title screen music are still bad, and the game has nothing to do with its predecessor, if you like the original Zelda game, you"ll probably like Robomaze III. The second volume has over 625 screens and 40 kinds of enemies. Users could register each of the "three" volumes independently, or together at a discounted rate. The surprise is that there are only two volumes: the third game in the bundle is the original Robomaze, which apparently had never sold before.

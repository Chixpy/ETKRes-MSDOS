The evil Nemesis has discovered how to use Time Gates and has trapped you once again down in the catacombs, preventing you from stopping him. He has the ability to send you back and forth through time where you have to challenge creatures from the very ends of eternity. 

The final installment in the Catacomb series, Terror of the Catacombs is very similar to the previous games, The Catacomb Abyss and Curse of the Catacombs. 

Once again, you"re a mage whose quest is to destroy the evil Nemesis. Just like in the previous installments, you can throw fireballs at your foes or use them to destroy certain walls. You can find bolts and nukes which allow more powerful attacks, healing potions, scrolls and keys. You can also find gems which allow you to see approaching enemies on your radar. 

The new levels and enemies often have a decidedly science-fiction feel to them; you"ll battle robots and wander around computer cores.

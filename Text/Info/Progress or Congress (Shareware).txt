"The congressmen are coming! They"ve entered the city with but one thought on their minds: ""get money get money get money""!

Everyone has run for their lives! Besides a few stores and other working places, the city is deserted!

...except for you!

Only you are left to locate the Majority Leader and stop his taxing of the city!

Fight through The City, buzz through InflationLand, sneak through the IRS Office, climb out of RecessionLand, and stop the Majority Leader once and for all!

Good Luck! (...you"ll need it...) "

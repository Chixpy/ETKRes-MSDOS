One of the earliest Japanese RPGs released overseas, Psychic War combines the anime-style graphics with first-person gameplay in this intriguing scifi RPG that features ESP powers instead of spells and arcade-style combat.Interestingly enough, the game is not as console-influenced as some of its cousins (e.g. Sorcerian), and puzzles enliven the action and provide good diversion from the hack-and-slash affair (or in this case, aim-and-shoot). Repetitive graphics are claustrophobic, but there are many neat gadgets to find and use.

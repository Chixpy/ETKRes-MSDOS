Definitely one of the best and most faithful Star Trek simulation game I"ve ever come across, Visual Star Trek is a perfect example that bigger doesn"t necessarily mean better.Almost every system on the Enterprise is accurately modelled, down to the status reports. You can choose the universes ranging from tiny for a quick play to enormous for a real campaign, the enemy AI is competent, and there are always battles to fight and zones to explore in this dynamic simulation that few know about. Two thumbs up!

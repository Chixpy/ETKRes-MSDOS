Stillhunt is a Korean-made fast-paced side-scrolling shooter similar to Gunstar Heroes. The player can choose between the male (Jean) and female (Houn) protagonists, who defend their homeland against an onslaught of mechanized creatures. Both characters can shoot in eight directions and begin with two weapons, a machine gun and a shotgun. Throughout the game they gain access to special weapons which can be obtained by shooting robots that carry them. Jean can use a laser gun, homing laser balls, and the powerful Exploder; Houn is able to wield a flamethrower, a napalm thrower, and homing grenades. A few stages differ depending on the character chosen by the player. Stages typically culminate with boss battles.

Pentti-Antero Sillank\u00f6yk\u00e4ys has been severely disabled for his whole life. After his 27th birthday he starts seeing prophetic dreams which help him to miraculously cure himself. He feels an urge to contribute something back to the society and starts a taxi service for the disabled; the Inva-taxi.

Even though Inva-taxi was originally meant to be a simple joke, it was one of those games that spread like a wildfire in Finnish BBS-systems and the gameplay was based on a truly unique feature: speech recognition by the player.

In Inva-taxi the player listens to the incomprehensible mongling of instructions given by disabled people and tries to select the right destination for the taxi ride. There really isn"t any more content in the game than listening to the samples and clicking the right spot on the map, but nevertheless, Inva-taxi retains it cult classic status in Finland.

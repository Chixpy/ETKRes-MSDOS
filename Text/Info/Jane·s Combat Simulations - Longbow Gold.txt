With the most authentic helicopter flight model up to date, detailed simulation of the milimeter wave radar on the Longbow, along with plenty of other weapon systems including your chain gun, FFAR rocket pods, Stinger missiles, anti-radar missiles, and more. Excellent terrain graphics. Command a wingman to assist you, and take on the Soviet-block equipment in multiple campaigns and historical missions including Panama and Desert Storm!

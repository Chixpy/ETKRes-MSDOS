Germany, November 9th 1989: The Berlin Wall has fallen. Now it is up to the player to organize and manage the "Aufschwung Ost" (German for "Upturn East" in reference to Eastern Germany, the former GDR) in this political business sim. Gameplay takes place on two scales: A large scale (East Germany) for power plants, highways and other infrastructure and a smaller, SimCity-like city-scale for specific buildings. Besides the historic "East Germany - 1989" scenario there six more, each with different problems (high pollution, national debt,...). None of them has a "goal" though so the game goes on forever (unless you decide to resign or you"re kicked out of office due to bad work).

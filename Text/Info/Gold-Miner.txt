This game is very much like the TRS-80 GoldMiner.  For those who are not familiar with the old game, you play a goldminer in search for gold to bring back to the bank for lots of cash.  Remember, that every move will cost you $5.00, so don"t waste moves.  You will have to face many treacherous things, such as an underground spring, solid rock, and cave-ins.  You will be moving also inside an elevator, which can"t be used it it is closed up by cave-ins or springs.  If it is then the game is over.  You start with $500, and must win by reaching $12,000.  The amount per ounce of gold will change every time you reach something.

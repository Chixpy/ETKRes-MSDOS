Robots that carry the names of historic Korean generals are the heroes of this SRPG, so it doesn"t surprise that the title of the game translates to generals. The enemies\u2014of course\u2014have Japanese names. Although the units are designed like mechas, they are not presented as manned but rather having a life on their own.

The game starts in simulation mode, where robots can be modified and ressources invested into new body parts for them. After a rather lengthy briefing the actuall mission starts, which takes the form of a rather dull and boring tactical battle. Somehow this part of the game doesn"t transport the feeling one has much control over the outcome of the battle, but maybe the mechanics just very complicated.

The overview map screen looks very functional without any unnecessary embellishment, but the robots in their attack animations attest competent pixel art craft. Too bad that it should remain rarely employed, as for most of their future games, FEW shifted to cheap prerendered graphics.

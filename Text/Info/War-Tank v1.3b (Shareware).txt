WAR-TANK is a 2 player, Tank vs. Tank game. Each tank is equipped 
with a high-power, plasma laser beam, not like the conventional shell 
throwers. 
The screen is split into 2 parts, the upper, battle, half shows the 
two tanks, and the battle field. The lower, readout, half shows the armour 
points, and the score. Each tank starts with 10 armour points, when these are 
gone you are dead, the other player wins that round, 5 rounds are played.

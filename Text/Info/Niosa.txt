According to the official website: "NIOSA\u00c2\u00ae (pronounced "knee-oh-sa") is a four-night event that celebrates San Antonio"s diverse cultural heritiage with 15 ethnic areas that serve fabulous foods in over 250 food booths and provides entertainment to over 85,000 revelers." This game (circa 1987) attempts to simulate the experience of attending this event. It"s an odd mix, sort of a timed adventure game where the object is to locate your friend, experience the festival, and leave by midnight. Overall I didn"t have great success in this game (see screenshot) but it"s worth checking out just because of how unique it is.

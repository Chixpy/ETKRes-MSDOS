The Trials Of Odysseus Kent is a short adventure game (an interactive RPG) about treasure, death and disappointment in which you play Odysseus, a young treasure hunter seeking a bonanza known as the Lost Treasure of Randolph McBoing.

We checked out the Win9x/ME version but there is a DOS version also available (925kB download).

This RPG (role playing game) has a Sierra-style interface (not unlike Space Quest 4 or King"s Quest 5) and you must gather the clues to sole the mystery of where the lost treasure is to be found.

From the same author of the famous Rob Blanc RPG series, The Trials Of Odysseus Kent doesn"t take itself too seriously and is a lot of (sometimes irreverent) fun.

The interface is easy to use, and the animated graphics corny-but-fun (watch for the old woman"s beating heart).

If you enjoy Sierra-style RPGs then The Trials Of Odysseus Kent is a "must have".

"Master Mind is the clasic game of logic and deduction. This version uses fruit instead of the traditional colors. The object of the game is to guess which pieces of fruit goes in which position. The player can choose to guess at 5 to 7 positions from 5 to 9 pieces of fruit with or without multiple pieces of the same kind of fruit and with 3 levels of reporting. This adds up to a tremendous variety of levels of play.

The game starts with a list of the available fruit at the bottom of the screen and a list of blank boxes for fill just above that. To select a fruit just click on the box containing that fruit and that box will be highlighted. Once a box is highlighted you may place that piece of fruit by clicking with the left button in the space you want it in (Clicking with the right button will erase anything in that box). If Multiple is on then you will be able to place a single piece of fruit in as many boxes as you like. If not then you can only but it in one box (if you want to move it then you must first remove the one already placed by clicking on it with the right button).

Once all of the positions are filled the OK button will light up. At this point changes can still be made. When all changes have been made then clicking on the OK button will tell you how many pieces you got right (according to your level of difficultly) and clear the guessing area to get ready for another try."

"The object of this game is to try to control the most planets (star systems) within a specified period of time (from 10 to 100 years). To achieve this, each player is given a ""home"" planet, with an initial number of ships, that produces 10 ships a year. All the other planets are owned by the computer and have randomly set producing capabilities from 0 to 20 ships per year. One year consists of each player sending out however many ships s/he chooses (no more than the number of ships on that planet) from any planet s/he owns. S/He may wish to send no ships at all

The game is best played with two or more players (up to 8), one player can play in which the object of the game would be to get as most worlds in as little time. In this case the computer acts as a passive player for it cannot send out fleets against your worlds."

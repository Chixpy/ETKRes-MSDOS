Ostensibly the shareware version of a more robust, non-quick Majik Adventure, as with their later Dragon Hunt this is a bit of a graphical roguelike, placing a fantasy adventurer smack in the middle of level 75 of a series of random and devious dungeons, filled to the gills with treasures and hostile creatures.  As an earlier effort Neurosport hadn"t yet extruded the perspective into three bewildering dimensions here, and so we still retain the traditional top-down view, prettied up (and range-of-view constrained) with a graphical tileset.

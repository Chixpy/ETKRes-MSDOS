You control a fleet of six ships, each of which can be one of three types: Destroyer, Carrier, or Frigate. Your fleet is tasked with hunting down and destroying a pack of up to 30 submarines. This task is complicated by the fact that the submarines move around and occasionally shoot at you, although you can tweak their aggressiveness and movement (including turning off movement altogether). The game ends when either all your ships or all the subs are destroyed.

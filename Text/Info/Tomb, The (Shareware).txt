The Tomb (not to be confused with Pharaoh"s Tomb ... see the screenshot if you"re not sure) is a remake of, or at least highly influenced by, the Tutankhamen arcade/home video game that was originally released in 1982. This version plays quite well, although the controls are a bit iffy at times. Decent graphics and classic gameplay, especially if you"ve played the original arcade game.

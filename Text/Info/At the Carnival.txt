The first and only game using "The Puzzle Gallery" engine, for which there were supposed to be multiple Puzzle Disks.  Extremely similar in style to Are We There Yet? and The Fool"s Errand, "At the Carnival" includes word searches, jigsaws, block puzzles, word squares, crosswords, jumbles, cryptograms, mazes, and more.

Each puzzle is set at and somewhat related to a different attraction at Hazard Park.  There are total of 40 attractions, and 180 puzzles

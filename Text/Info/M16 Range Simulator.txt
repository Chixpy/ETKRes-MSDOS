I designed this program to simulate the fun and excitement of firing the M16A1 rifle.  You will notice that it takes two hands to operate this computerized rifle.  Move the sights with the joystick and fire with the F1 button.  I did this to allow you the maximum opportunity to miss.

NOTA: Requiere joystick.

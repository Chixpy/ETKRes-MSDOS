Lin Wu Challenge is a lackluster Mahjongg game from Lasersoft, a German developer.Like numerous other solitaire Mahjongg games, your goal is to remove 2 matching tiles at a time to clear the pile. The gameplay is very straightforward and quite dull, as it doesn?t have nearly as many options as Activision?s Shanghai, and the graphics is below par. Worth a look only if you collect Mahjongg games. There are many better games on the market.

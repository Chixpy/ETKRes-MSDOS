Yet another simulation of the yet to enter service F-22, probably the most advanced fighter of the world. As with most Novalogic games, however, the emphasis here is on action and graphics, rather than in simulating the real thing.

The game offers a standard series of campaigns as well as a quick mission mode and multiplayer support for deathmatch and cooperative games using a feature similar to the "spawn" feature found on WarCraft 2.

G-Netix allows to participate in growing of a human embryo. By affecting environmental conditions (oxygen, pH, hydrogen levels) and changing the gene structure itself it"s possible to observe the growth of a single cell into a complex organism. Each action evokes a response from an embryo, ranging from death to unusual mutations (i.e. a simple change in chromosome chain may develop insect-like eyes).

The player is a scientist who is circling the earth in a space laboratory. During the journey, a deadly virus hits earth and wipes out the entire human population in a few days. With no one left, it is the scientist"s job to recreate life and control the conditions to let new embryos grow and evolve.

The game is bundled with an extensive summary on genetics including such subjects as DNA Replication, Mutation, Cell Division and Cell Cycle, etc.

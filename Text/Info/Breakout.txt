A simple clone of the old Atari bouncing ball game "Breakout". There"s some nice color cycling, the controls are decent, and you have more freedom of movement compared to the original. Not too much to say here though, other than this is one of the earlier creations of Ken Silverman, who later would create Ken"s Labyrinth as well as the Build engine which was used for Duke Nukem 3D and other classic early 3D games. (Note: If you"re interested in a fantastic modern Windows breakout/Arkanoid style game, I highly recommend BreakQuest! I"ve registered it, it"s tons of fun!)

Cricket. It?s not a world wide sport and I have to say it can be pretty boring at times. However, it?s one of those sports that?s a bit more relaxing to watch. It?s not like watching a football match (soccer American sports fans) where you?re constantly in danger of a cardiac arrest because your team need one goal to stay in the Premier League. Cricket is a different kettle of fish all together. Cricket matches don?t take hours, they take days. Cricket is all about sitting back and having a rest. 

As is the nature of cricket, you?ll either be batting or bowling. Batting is handled by the use of the directional keys and two fire button. Pressing various directions performs different shots.

To be honest, there seems to be a lot of luck involved. However, if you know your cricket then you?ll love the attention to detail and will spend hours refining your bating skills.

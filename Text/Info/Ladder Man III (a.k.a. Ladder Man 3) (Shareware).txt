Help Ladder Man collect all the light bulbs in each of the 30 puzzle rooms and then try to reach the elusive doorway. Use Ladder Man\u2019s ladder to reach objects like TNT, boats, balloons and crates, while avoiding deadly lasers and dangerous water hazards. You must literally try to construct his escape.

Ladder Man 3 is side-view puzzle game which involves using a ladder instead of jumping. (If episode one and two of this game exist somewhere, they are not readily available.) The goal is to collect all of the lightbulbs in each room and then get to the exit; this involves using your ladder, pushing blocks around, and interacting with other elements of the environment. We"re given very little in the way of a backstory or motivation for ladder man. Who is he? Why is he collecting lightbulbs? What existential or metaphysical concerns does his quest represent? But maybe I"m getting too deep. Ladder Man 3 is an interesting puzzle game for fans of the genre.

DEFENSE is a game of strategy ,skill, and quick reflexes. Just as in real football, the offense and defense try to outguess each other. Just as in real football, the biggest gains are made by calling plays that fool the defense and vice versa. When the play starts, YOU - not the computer - play the game. Tackles can be made or missed depending on your skill in moving defenders and ballcarriers on the screen and how fast the player on defense can hit the tackle button. And the player on offense can block, so that the reaction times of both players become key factors. YOU make passes complete or incomplete. YOU cause sacks, interceptions, and fumbles. YOU can block kicks. Infractions of the rules result in penalties. Even the pace at which the game is played is about the same as that of a real game. It is not a hard game to play, but to play it well takes practice and knowing the subtle tricks of the game.

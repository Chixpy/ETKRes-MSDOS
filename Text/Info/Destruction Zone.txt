Somewhere near the centre of our galaxy lies an enormous dark  station.  From time to time, a group of challengers travel out to the station to turn  on  the lights, transforming the "Dark Zone" into the "Destruction Zone".

The station has three levels of different sizes. Each level is large in area, but the ceiling lies only a few metres above the floor. It is the battle field for the most famous war game in the galaxy.

A series of triangular tanks essentially made up of three huge cylinders, are teleported into the zone and hover in their positions, repelled from the  floor and ceiling by strong electric forces. The liquid fuel of each tank can be seen splashing around in the inside of each cylinder and by looking closely  inside, a few cables and tubes are also visible. Due to the radioactive fuels used each tank softly radiates a unique colour.

As the Destruction Zone becomes even brighter, the tanks start to move.  The first round has begun. The tank controllers switch between a range of  weapons, blasting their foes in all directions.

As time passes, the tanks glow dimmer, for they are all low on weapon  fuel.

They wait in corners, absorbing the Zone light until they  glow  brighter,  and then they launch another attack.

When a tank has taken too much damage, it is teleported out of the Zone with the unharmed controller, so everyone lives  to  play  another  game.  From  all around the galaxy, the D-Zone enthusiasts are waiting for the next  score-board update.

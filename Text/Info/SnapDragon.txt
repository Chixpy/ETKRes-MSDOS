SnapDragon is a good collection of open-ended activities that facilitate early larning for toddlers/preschoolers.Friendly Snap Dragon and his pal Teddy will escort your child on a tour of exciting, animated places. Sleep under the stars. Have fun on a farm. Explore outer space. There are no right or wrong answers, no words to read and no points to earn. The game focuses on creative learning and fun, with bright, attractive VGA graphics. The game helps develop early-learning skills for math, science and reading. Your child will learn to arrange animals, toys and shapes by size, use, color and more, then photograph animated scenes and create his or her own on-screen photo album. One of the best activities is the electronic coloring book, which can be printed out on paper. Every scene is full of animating characters and objects to interact with, similar to The Manhole. Overall, a fun electronic toybox that will teach your children a lot of skills while they are having fun. Thumbs up!

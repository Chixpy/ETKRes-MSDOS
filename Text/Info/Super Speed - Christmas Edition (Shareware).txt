A car racing game similar to the older game Super Sprint. This version has received a Chistmas-themed makeover ... however, the effect on the actual game is very small. You race your little red car around the track, picking up items and powerups, while trying not to crash. It can be fun, but it"s tricky to get the hang of at first. Average VGA graphics and sound effects. (Note: I had some problems with the keyboard settings ... it wouldn"t let me use some keys.)

Spinout is a clone of the game Breakout and features similar gameplay. At the top of the screen are four rows of bricks; the goal is to remove all of the bricks by hitting them with a bouncing ball. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to deflect the ball. The game begins with five balls, and if a ball makes it past the paddle it is lost. The game ends when all bricks are successfully destroyed or all five balls are lost.

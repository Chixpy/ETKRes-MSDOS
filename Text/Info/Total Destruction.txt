TD is a shoot em up game like raptor.

I think it is one of the most beautiful and fun to play games ever made in QB. It has great graphics (as good as raptor) and even better explosions.I think this game sets a new standard in QB programming.

As the name suggests this game is rather destructive, flying over an alien space station. You can destroy lots of different enemies, towers and buildings.

The Thunder Age has been marked by an industrial revolution. Having discovered the power of steam, the races of that magical medieval realm began to produce firearms and construct steam-powered golems. However, the development was stopped by a horrifying event, known as the Darkfall. Hordes of unholy creatures, or "nocturnals", were released into the world. Some people found in themselves no courage to resist them, and began cooperating with the nocturnals, earning the title of "Corrupted". Only the bravest of adventurers will dare to venture into the dark underground areas where the forces of evil have built their stronghold.

World of Aden: Thunderscape is a 3D dungeon-crawling role-playing game. The player creates a party of up to six characters, choosing among several races, including traditional medieval fantasy species such as elves and dwarves, but also some races unique to the game. The player also chooses the class and the initial combat-oriented skills of the characters. Combat is turn-based and takes place on the same screen as exploration. When characters gain enough experience to level up, the player can raise their parameters or have them learn new magic spells.

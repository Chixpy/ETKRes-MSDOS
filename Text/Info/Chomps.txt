Chomps is a clone of the game Pac-Man. In the game the player controls a smiley face with the goal of collecting all of the dots in one of four mazes. To make this task more difficult there are a number of monsters that roam around the maze; Like Pac-Man"s ghosts, contact with a monster will cost the player a life. Each of the monsters has a different personality and will chase down the player in a unique manner; the number of monsters in the maze depends on the level being played. The only defense the player has against the monsters are the power dots; after collecting a power dot, the player is temporarily able to chase the monsters; bonus points are earned for catching them. Periodically an additional bonus item will appear in the maze which earns additional points if collected. The game features four different mazes, and each time a maze is cleared the speed and difficulty increase.

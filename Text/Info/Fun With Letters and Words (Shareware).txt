Dear Parent: 
 
When our older daughter, Lisa, was approaching two, we began developing a program to satisfy her curiosity about the alphabet. That initial minimal effort has now grown into a multi-level reading program, which now four years later delights our four year-old Amy. In creating Fun with Letters and Words, we have spoken with reading specialists and parents.  We have also picked up ideas watching other children use the program to ensure that Fun with Letters and Words provides a good balance between play and educational activity.  We would hope that you will likewise be inclined to offer your suggestions by dropping us a note. 

As Lisa and Amy have played at the computer with their special program, we have gained some insights into using Fun with Letters and Words.  And so we suggest the following with the hope that you and your child will spend as many enjoyable hours 
together with the program as our family has.  (From here on, all children are understandably referred to as "she.")

The second entry in Masterplay"s Star Saga, combination of science fiction role-playing with a strategy board game. Gameplay allows for up to six players, who assume the role of pre-created characters (dossiers are provided in the game package) - a true merging of computerized and non-computerized RPG elements.

The package also includes a fold-out poster map that acts as the game board, six colored stones for player markers, and a stack of game text booklets, which minimizes the number of game disks.

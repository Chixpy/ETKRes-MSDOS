This is a Bomberman style game that, not too surprisingly, uses bombs and bugs! The game looks really good, and includes lots of SB sound effects. You can play with up to four players, and there are a couple different levels, each with unique graphics. The only problem is that many of the options are turned off in the unregistered version, and you have to wait a bit before starting the game. Still, it"s fun to play, and definitely worth a try.

"The object of the game is to push the mouse against blocks on the screen, moving the blocks into position to block in a cat, which will turn into cheese when completely blocked in. You get points for blocking in a cat and for eating cheese. The number of points increases as levels go higher, and as the speed of the game increases. Moving a block on top of a cheese spot removes the cheese, but doesn"t count as eating it. Be careful! Since you can get a cat, it"s only fair that a cat can get you in return! Whenever a cat gets in a square immediately adjacent to the mouse, the mouse gets killed! This includes diagonally adjacent squares.

Oh, by the way.... the cats can move diagonally, but the mouse can only move horizontally and vertically. Use the arrow keys ON THE NUMERIC KEYBOARD to make the mouse move. There are ten levels to the game, with ten cats per level. The mouse has five lives per game."

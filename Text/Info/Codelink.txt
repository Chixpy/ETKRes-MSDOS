You awaken in a stupor. The jarring of the lock being thrown stirs your senses. Immediately three guards enter your cell and quickly bind your hands. You"re carried down a maze of hallways and arrive before a steel security door. Inside a chilled room are numerous wires and cables attached to a single reclining chair. It"s armrest holds a compact monitor that flickers with static. Doctors arrive as the guard straps you to the chair and begins to attack a barbed needle to the base of your neck. The doctors open a large metal case and remove a red vial and syringe.

They slide the needle into your left arm and depress the syringe. You watch the red luminous liquid flood into your veins. Other doctors seem to connect an array of wires from somewhere behind you to the monitor. The room spins and then folds inward until only a bubble of the image remains. Your body tingles almost painfully. Blood pounds in your ears as your heart keeps timing with a strange electronic pulse crawling up and down your spine. The room is far away. All there is to see now is the mindless static of the monitor. And then... there"s light!

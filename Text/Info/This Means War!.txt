A post-apocalyptic real-time strategy game set in a world where a virus has destroyed nearly all computer technology and armies fight over the land and the technology on it. You work for the UN as its primary strategist and encounter such enemies as a religious nut, a Crocodile Dundee rip-off, and a spoiled countess.

Please accept my heart felt apologies for releasing this crappy RPG! ;)

Seriously though, this game only took a few hours to do, and it is intended to be taken as nothing more than a joke. Needless to say, although everyone in this game is a real person (with the exception of GODQB and InnDude) none of the events and conversations in this game are real... If any of this has ever happened before, it"s purely coincidental.

This game is very easy to play. The arrow keys are used to move around, you press H to get healed (by drinking coffee ^_^), and you press S to see your stats. Simple no?

Have fun!

World of Xeen combines two games - Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen - into a single game that can be played continuously. The player-controlled party can travel between the worlds of the two games using special devices that can find through exploration. Completing the main quests in both games opens the final quest, which requires the player to unite both sides of the world Xeen. This version also adds digitized speech to the games.

Prigodi Pionerki Kseni (The Adventures of Ksenia the Young Pioneer) is an unofficial stand-alone total conversion of The Adventures of Captain Comic made by Yuri Lesiuk, a programmer from Chernihiv, Ukraine. While the game mechanics remain the same, all graphics and levels had been replaced with "images familiar to the Soviet people" in the author"s own words. The plot of the game is as follows: Ksenia, a Young Pioneer girl, travels through the various locations of the planet Pioneria and overcomes obstacles in order to find Captain Comic.

Ksenia was created as a demonstration of software reverse-engineering, a topic on which Yuri Lesiuk published a number of papers in the local computer programming magazine, Programmistskie Vedomosti ("The Programmers" Newsletter"). Yuri Lesiuk analysed the file formats of the game and wrote tools to edit graphics, levels and data archives; these tools were also supplied as part of the demonstration sample.

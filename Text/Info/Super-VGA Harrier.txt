Super-VGA Harrier is an upgraded version of AV-8B Harrier Assault, but modified to use SVGA resolution (640x480), otherwise, the game is identical. You lead a marine expeditionary force trying to occupy West Timor. At your command is a full Amphibious Assault Group, including ships, helicopters, Harriers, landing crafts, and more. The campaign is full real-time and you can play only as the commander if you wish to.

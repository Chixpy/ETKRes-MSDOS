Xeno Ball is a neat puzzle game that is like Pipe Dreams meets Marble Madness: you control a living, rolling red ball that must lay track portions to make a path to the exit.Levels get harder quickly, with increasing variety of track shapes and sizes. Overall, a very addictive game that combines arcade action seamlessly with puzzles. Highly recommended.

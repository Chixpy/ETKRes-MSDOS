The final installment in the Jill of the Jungle trilogy features improved animations, new graphics, new music, new levels and a myriad of new enemies. It also features a map-based world which does not exist in the first two games.

The story thus far: after having explored the jungle and defeated the forced of darkness in the first two games, Jill must endure another quest in order to save the jungle from being destroyed: Jill must save the prince, who has been kidnapped by an evil green lizardman who wishes to destroy the jungle and build condos instead. Unless Jill saves the prince, he will succeed in his evil cause.

CrossCheck is an excellent and very rare PC version of TSR"s board game of the same name, designed for 1-4 players.The game is a unique cross between a typical crossword puzzle and Scrabble. Four players (3 of which can be computer-controlled) write answers to crossword-style questions on an erasable 19x19" board, to create a chain of words. On your turn, you roll one die and whatever you roll is how many letters (of your choice) you can add to the board. You will then have to guess the correct word of that length from reading a crossword puzzle clue. The winner is the first one to create a chain of words that touch your "home base" on one end of the screen. 

Although the game is fun and quite addictive, luck plays an important role because there"s not much you can do if you roll a one. This annoys me a bit -- especially because I never seem able to roll high numbers ;P Regardless, the game is very enjoyable and even educational, since the vocabulary is large (the game even allows you to use synonyms of the correct word), and some clues are quite challenging. If you enjoy crossword puzzles or word games in general, CrossCheck is well worth your time, especially since TSR has long discontinued the board game. Highly recommended!

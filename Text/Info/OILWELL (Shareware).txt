OILWELL is a game of strategy and luck for one player. As the game begins, you have just just inherited an oil company from your rich uncle. The oil company has $50,000 in cash, a single oilwell, and a mortgage. During the game you must use your skill to increase your worth to $3,000,000 in order to pay off the mortgage. You have twenty turns in which to do this. Each turn consists of unlimited moves of buying, selling, refining, searching for oil, starting wells, and drilling on wells. At the end of each turn you must pay your taxes. During the game you may have to face strikes by the union, fires, and random occurrences which may influence the cost of crude oil or your refining costs.

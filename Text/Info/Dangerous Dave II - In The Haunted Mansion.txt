Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion (a.k.a Dave 2) is a sequel to original surprisingly successful Dangerous Dave. A rather a-typical platform game, in Dave 2 you run through a huge mansion with many different levels, battling all kinds of monsters and collecting items (yes, mostly bonus points). Every so-and-so points you get an additional life, and every so-and-so levels you combat a boss.

One of the things that make this game unique is that instead of just having a limited amount of ammunition, you have a shotgun and can shoot 8 bullets at any given time. However, you must wait in order for Dave to reload his gun. This gives for some interesting scenes in which you frantically try to shoot your enemies and reload the gun just in time to shoot them again before they manage to kill you. Another thing that sets the game apart is the ability to aim your gun in several angles (generally: up, down or straight ahead), which again makes the game a great deal more interesting.

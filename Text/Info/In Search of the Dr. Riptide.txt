As a naval agent your job is to find the secret undersea laboratory of evil scientist, Dr. Riptide and give an end to its destructive effects in this side scrolling arcade action.

In your explorations of the underwater caverns, your main vehicle is a submarine. You can also use a JASON submersible that will help you to reach smaller areas with its small size. 

Your ability can be enhanced by collecting Power-Ups.

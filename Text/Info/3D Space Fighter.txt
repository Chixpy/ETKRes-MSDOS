Throughout the 20th century we have called the time that is now "THE FUTURE". We have longed to meet other life forms, to learn from them and to finally see proof that we are not alone in this universe. Now at the dawn of the 21st century we have finally found that proof.
Everybody expected this first contact would be peaceful and friendly... sadly it was just the opposite. When we first discovered alien forms approaching they were still light years away, butapproaching fast.
Earth"s defenses were weak and the first wave of alien destroyers wiped out most of the human structures. Earth united and gave birth to the "ULTIMATE SPACE FIGHTER" who could stand ground against the alien destroyers. The code name of this space fighter was "Sigma Terminus" and you have been given the chance to fly it in the name of the victory of mankind.

Christmas Matchup is a Christian-themed Concentration game about the Bible. The cards are images relating to stories of the Bible, which the game attempts to educate the player about.

The game is identical to traditional forms of the Concentration game. 1 to 3 players take turns turning over cards and trying to find matching pairs. The winner is the player with the most matches at the end of the game.

The Windows version adds additional features, such as card descriptions and information on how to become a Christian.

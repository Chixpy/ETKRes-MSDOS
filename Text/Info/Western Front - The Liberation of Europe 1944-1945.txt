A grand strategical game of World War 2 in the west from 1944 to 1945. Both the Western and the Italian front are covered in detail; the Eastern front is simulated in order to reflect the influences of a two-front war. Scenarios range from operation "Overlord" to the "Battle of the Bulge". The game is the logical successor of Second Front: Germany Turns East which covers the war in the east.

In Hong Kong Hustle, you are the Tai Pan of the largest international trading house in Hong Kong. It is June 30, 1997, and China is due to take over the Colony on July 1. You have just learned that the Chinese intend to confiscate much of the property of the major trading houses. Your objective is to collect 15 bags of gold and jewels, which you have stored around the city, get them to your boat before midnight, and escape.

You disguise yourself as a factory worker and set out from Repulse Bay, using only public transportation, to visit the locations in your notebook.

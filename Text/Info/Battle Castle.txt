"To whoever finds this scroll:

Help me please! I have been taken prisoner by the Evil Archmage. I"m sure my father, the king will reward any person who helps in my escape. Please, hurry. The Archmage is going to force me to marry him; what he calls marriage! I would rather die! If no one answers this please, that is what will surely happen.

Again, please hurry.

The Princess"

Zoo keepers from an alien world have scoured human history to steal 7 important figures from different epochs, and it is your job to rescue them. First you will have to explore four worlds to find the 6 pieces of their Time Machine, avoiding the chasing aliens.

Unlike Humans 2, this is a full sequel to the game known as Evolution: Dino Dudes on some systems with a new game engine, rather than merely a data disk with new levels. 

As before the gameplay is influenced by Lemmings. Each of your characters have their own abilities, including fire-creation, grabbing and smashing, which must be used in conjunction to beat the puzzles before you. Passwords are offered for each level.

A building is on fire and you have to rescue babies jumping (jumping?) from the building. Your two man fire fighter team is the only thing between life and certain death for the "bouncing babies". Use your fire fighter stretcher/trampoline to "bounce" the babies safely into the ambulance.

The game has only 3 keys to play (1, 2, 3) which represents the positions where you can place your fireman team: Left, Middle, Right. Anticipate where the babies will fall from their "jumping angle". Multiple and faster babies will jump off the building as you advance in the game.

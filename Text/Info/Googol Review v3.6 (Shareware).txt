Thank you for trying my Shareware program, Googol Review. I wrote this program to help kids (and parents) have some fun while learning math.
           
Googol Review is a vastly improved version of the old program which was part of the original "Googol Math Games". Review now includes both number and word problems!
           
There are hundreds of synonyms used in the word problems, and thousands of possible combinations. Some of the vocabulary may be too advanced for younger children, which is why the actual numbers can be printed in a different color. They can simply skim over the words they don"t know, and just concentrate on the math.
          
The underlying theory is that children will gradually get used to the larger words, thereby improving reading skills. Older players can try the "Expert" level, with all of the numbers spelled out!

All squads are editable before starting a game, and up to eight players can compete at the same time.

Managers have the usual ability to set player bonuses and ticket prices, plan training at both global (a weekly 40-hour pool to be distributed between gameplay, fitness, set plays and skills) and individual (the manager can insist in one of the ten individual skills) levels, sign, sell and loan players and set formations and tactics (setting wingbacks, pack defense or offside trap. among others).

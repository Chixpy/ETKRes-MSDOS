This text-based simulation definitely won"t appeal to everyone, but if you"ve ever had visions of running your own record company, and enjoy simulation games you might want to download this game. You create your own record company, then attempt to sign the right bands (many popular bands are included) to try to earn the most money. It includes lots of stats, numbers, etc but don"t expect fancy graphics or sound.

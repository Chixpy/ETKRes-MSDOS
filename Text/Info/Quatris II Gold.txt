Quatris II Gold is a Tetris clone, but it"s a very well made one, apparently the sequel to the original Quatris (above). It includes many new falling block configurations, a plethora of options, and is presented in an attractive way. There are subtle touches everywhere which really add to the experience. The game itself is mostly the same as Tetris with some new block shapes, but there are some other things which can spice up the game like bombs and "banking" blocks for later. Overall a very well made game.

Excellent sequel to Grand Slam Bridge released after a long 6-year gap.This time, the game sports a revamped engine, outstanding VGA graphics, a much stronger AI, and plenty of new options. The game lets you can play over one billion hands of bridge with strong computer players. Advanced Players will enjoy the wide range of bidding and playing skills, while novices to the game will appreciate the excellent library of tutorial hands and hints features. Flexible practice mode allows rebids, redeals, replay of hands, and double dummy play. The graphics are very nice in VGA, although the game could use more sounds and music to liven up the experience.

Still, Grand Slam Bridge is a very polished, very competent bridge game that truly stands the test of time, even against newer bridge releases that focus more on multimedia pizzazz than good old fashioned fun. Highly recommended for all bridge players.

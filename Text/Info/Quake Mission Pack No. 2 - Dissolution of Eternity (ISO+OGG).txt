An original Quake add-on, Dissolution of Eternity sets out to expand upon the Quake universe by adding something fresh, while preserving the basic concept of the game. To this end, Dissolution incorporates new themes and adds a number of new monsters, weapons, and levels. 

Armaments such as the grappling hook, multi-rocket, and multi-grenade launchers, and lava nailgun all make their appearance. New foes include the Hell Spawn, Electric Eels, Phantom Swordsmen, Ogres, Wraths and Guardians.

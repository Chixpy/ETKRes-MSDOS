A decent game from a company famous for oldie strategy games, The Holy Grail has a strong plot but very primitive parser compared to the likes of Infocom games.As the name implies, your task is to find the legendary holy grail. It"s not a very long game, and most puzzles are simplistic. Recommended as a dose of nostalgia only.

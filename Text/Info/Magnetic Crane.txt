Controlling a powerful electromagnet-tipped crane of the junkyard variety, the player has a limited amount of magnetic "energy" at their disposal to use to pick up, re-orient and re-arrange a jumbled pile of railway cars into a sensible sequence (spelling out "Dialog "89", the developer and year of development) with engine at the front and caboose at the rear (a loose caboose, one should note... that will shoot off the end of the screen, rendering the level uncompletable, if unobstructed.)

At heart, this is a collection of three different Breakout variants (Brick Wall, Falling Walls, and The Blast Adventure), dished up in the trademark Moraffware style of eye-popping, fauvist colour in more supported video resolution modes than you might previously have believed existed.  In all modes gameplay is primarily concerned with bouncing a ball off a paddle on the bottom of the screen and into blocks or bricks suspended above, destroying them.  In Falling Walls, as you might have been able to guess, the suspension is not complete, while in The Blast Adventure game mode, priority is on removing obstructions from around a gateway to the next level rather than on eliminating all bricks from the screen.  In all modes, various conventional power-up types assist the player in their brick demolition.

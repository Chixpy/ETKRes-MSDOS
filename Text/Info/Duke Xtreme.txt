The Ultimate Duke Nukem Command center.  4 new weapons, 50 new levels and 2 new enemies! also the option to modify many different things.

This add-on plays like any other Duke game, but what"s different is the multiplayer command center. Choose your weapons, levels (50!) and people you play with.  Also pretty much any internet connection works.

Among the new weapons are a knife and a Silent Uzi.  Rounding it up is a roman candle launcher (just like RPG) and a statue maker (just like Freezer).

New enemies include the king cobra (giant rattle snake) and the gorilla captain (like a super pig cop with lots of guns).

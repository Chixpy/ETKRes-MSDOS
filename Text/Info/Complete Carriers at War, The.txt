One can not say that the Complete Carriers at War is the third game of the series, although technically it is. Essentially, it is a joint publication of the first two parts, while preserving all their merits, and the addition of a large number of new scenarios. game covers not only the Pacific battles of World War II, but almost all the rest of its naval battles, which involved aircraft carriers. Moreover, together with large transactions (such as the Arctic convoys) is deep and peripheral (ie, holding the allies of Madagascar in Vichy France in 1942). All available to you 41 (!) Scenario (including those that are in the first two parts), almost all of which have a lot of options. There is also an editor for making your cards. From major innovations worth noting only the appearance of the special signs indicating the length of day and night for each job (so you do not have to define it by experience) and some changes in the images of different parts interfaces that make it more appropriate to the harsh conditions of the war at sea. only disappointment is the lack of campaigns in all games of the series. Although the choice of scenarios is huge and extremely diverse, yet the presence of possible sequences to perform several related jobs would add to the game even more interesting. I am deeply convinced that the introduction of any series of games should start in order of their release, even if it is possible to study, for example, first second - objectively better, - and then the first part. But in this case it is quite possible exception: you can start the game right from the Complete Carriers at War , because it includes everything that is in two of its predecessor and adds more variety.

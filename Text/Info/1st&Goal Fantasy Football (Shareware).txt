"Admit it Bunky! Ever since you were 10 years old, with your grubby fist full of football cards that smelled like bad gum, you KNEW that you could do a better job of coaching your favorite football team than the clown that was currently running them straight into the league"s cellar.


You knew that the trade for that broken-down running back would never pan out and you knew that the rookie receiver they dealt away for him was a potential star. Now 1st&Goal Fantasy Football gives you the opportunity that the NFL refused to give you. YOU can now become the Owner, General Manager, Head Coach and Chief Scout for your very own team.

YOU draft the team and tailor it to YOUR specifications. YOU make the game-to-game decisions that make or break your club. Do you trade Montana for Simms and Sharpe? Do you take a chance and sign Jackson? Bench Aikman? Sign Anderson to a long term contract? It"s all up to you in 1st&Goal! Make the wrong choices and end up in the cellar. Make the right moves and win the league championship (and in some leagues a wheelbarrow load of cash!)"

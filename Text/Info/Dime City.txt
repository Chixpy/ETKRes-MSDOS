This follow-up of sorts to Mad TV (designed by the same designer) is based on the same engine and look, but unfortunately it lacks the charm and wit that make Mad TV an underground classic.This time instead of a hapless TV reporter in love, you are a gangster wannabe in love who must amass fame and fortune by nefarious means to achieve his heart"s desire. Recruit thugs, plan shootouts, and more in this unique game that doesn"t live up to Mad TV, but comes close at times.

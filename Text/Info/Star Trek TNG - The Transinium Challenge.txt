This obscure adventure game is an excellent Star Trek: TNG title that captures all the flavor of the TV series, with cool digitized animations of the cast and object.The game features the excellent "conference" and "analyze" strategic options similar to TRANS Fiction"s other underdog Hidden Agenda, where you evaluate found objects and solicit opinions from crew members. As Riker, unravel the mystery surrounding a space station attack. Highly recommended.

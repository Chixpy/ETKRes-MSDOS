"D. A. Leary"s ""Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure"" set the stage for top-quality shareware interactive fiction in the 90"s. Continuing the tradition of Infocom"s 80"s adventure games, Leary took a fresh look at the computer adventure ""formula,"" in some cases turning it on its ear. While intending to parody the Zorks and Colossal Caves we"re all familiar with, Leary managed to create a lore (hilarious as it is) that stands on its own.

In ""Unnkulian Unventure II: The Secret of Acme,"" I"ve tired to preserve the essential elements that made Leary"s game so much fun: the sense of humor and the puzzles that hark back to the ""golden era"" of interactive fiction (yet sometimes go directly against the veteran gamer"s instincts), but most of all the witty irreverence. I"ve also tried to add to the mythos, and in some cases give earlier ambiguities my own interpretation while at the same time opening up new questions for exploration in ""Unnkulian Unventure III"".

Though ""Unnkulian Unventure II"" is an outgrowth of ""Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure,"" it is more challenging than its predecessor. The later puzzles are quite difficult, and will require more time and experience to solve. As a result, I strongly recommend that you solve the first adventure before playing this one, particularly since some of the new puzzles are thematically related to puzzles in the first game."

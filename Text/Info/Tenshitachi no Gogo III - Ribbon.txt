The third game in the  Tenshitachi no Gogo series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. In this installment, the player assumes the role of a male teacher in a high school. Many pretty female students (and pretty female teachers) surround the hero, but he only has one girl in mind: Haru Okamoto, whom he calls "his angel". In order to win her love, the hero will have to know her better - which also means knowing the secrets of students and teachers alike...

Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon is a Japanese-style (puzzle-less) adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by choosing verb commands ("Look", "Ask", "Search", etc.), which lead to sub-menus with object choices. The game mostly advances in a linear way, but at certain points the story can end prematurely, depending on the player"s choice.

The KURSK program is a strategy game that simulates tank vs tank warfare on the Russian front in World War II.  It features accurate sillouette drawings of eight historical tanks of that period, with each tank rated for the thickness of its front and side armor.  Playing the game is a simple five-step procedure. Always keep an eye on the status line, which is the bottom line of the screen.

BOT was my first robot-programming game. Basically, you write a flow-chart style program to control a robot, and then pit it against other robots to battle it out in an arena. Unfortunately, the flow-charts are not graphical, and instead you have to program with numbers only. It"s rather cryptic, but it was fun for me and a few friends at the time. This game was superceded by R-Bot.

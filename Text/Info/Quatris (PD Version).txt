A nice EGA Tetris clone, with a few simple variants. For one, there are a couple of different blocks. Another is that there are also bombs in the game, and each block has a number; if, when you clear a line, the total of all blocks in the line match the "Quatris Number" you get bonus points. Although it looks quite nice, the only annoying part about this game is that the PC speaker sounds can"t be turned off. (They aren"t too loud or annoying, though.)

In the year since we released version 2.5, author John Stanback has been steadily improving Zarkov.  In May, 1992, Zarkov was one of 24 computers playing in the Aegon Insurance Company"s 7th Annual Man-Machine Competition in The Hague, Netherlands.  Zarkov"s 3-3 score , running on a 486-33 (the only losses were to GMs Bronstein and Cifuentes), was better than any other commercially available program or dedicated machine!  Two specially-built machines did better - a souped-up Mephisto model which would cost over $10,000 if sold, and a university research project using a whole network of computers.  (Zarkov has beaten the special Mephisto machine twice in a row in tournaments head-to-head now - first in New Mexico last November, with Zarkov 2.5 using a special HP Risc machine, and more recently in Austria on a standard 486!)  Two Chessmachines running at over 30MHz, (instead of  the standard 8-10 MHz models) tied with Zarkov, as did former world correspondence champion Hans Berliner"s Hitech program.  Further back in the field were two versions of Marty Hirsch"s highly-acclaimed M-Chess (both scored 2.5 - 3.5).\u0009

The organizer of the Aegon tournament, Cock de Gorter, was so enthusiastic about the new version of Zarkov that he asked us if we would like to include one of his own specialized opening book files with version 2.6.  You will find this file (Aegon.bk) on your new disk.

A small "Lemmings" clone with a twist. This time around you have to kill the "Lamers" instead of saving them, " in order to prevent the lamers from reaching the computer. If enough of them reach it, they will destroy it and you will lose."

You have several weapons at your disposal, which include a hand-gun, a machine-gun, bombs and mines.

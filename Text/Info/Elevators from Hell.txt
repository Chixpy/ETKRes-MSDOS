The objective in Elevators from Hell is to collect all seven tokens (one on each floor) and then escape the building... alive!

The building consists of seven floors, each floor has two elevators (left and right), the elevator panel (center) and a token (between left elevator and the panel). The panel will call the nearest elevator, regardless of left or right.

Sounds easy? It would be if the player were alone in the building. Unfortunately, there is a Robo Guard patrolling the building. If the player comes too close to the Robo Guard, he will fire his red laser beam to kill the player.

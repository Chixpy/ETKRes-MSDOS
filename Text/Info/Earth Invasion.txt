The Yanchooz with their leader Xyfud Plasfoc are the bad guys of the universe. They try to destroy and enslave all other races and you are one of them. To be more specific, you are their worst fighter who screwed up the last 18 missions. As a consequence your leader is pretty pissed off of you and wants you dead. Your task is it to head to Earth, the only race who could defend itself successfully against the Yanchooz so far, and open a road for your capital ships. The problem is that you are completely alone. Nobody believes in you and now it"s up to you to accomplish this suicidal mission.

Earth Invasion is a shareware space arcade shooter with 10 missions. In each of the 10 missions you have to defeat five waves of human ships that differ from each other in their type and their amount. To clean each system a capital ship needs to be destroyed. After that you return to your home destroyer but your ship won"t be repaired (remember, they want you dead) and you carry your defects into the next system. But your space fighter is equipped with HIJKE shield converters. From time to time a HIJKE capsule prowls through the system and when you catch it your shield regenerates. Unfortunately you only have 30 shield converters i.e. you should ration these capsules. 

Shareware version is limited to the first five missions and you can"t save your game.

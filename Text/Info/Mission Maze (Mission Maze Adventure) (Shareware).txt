Also known as "Mission Maze Adventure". Here is proof that dosgames.com goes and searches out some obscure DOS games for you to play: This game was made by William Soleau (of Soleau Software fame) but it is not listed on his official site! :) This text-mode game involves going on missions to find several items by using TNT and other tools while avoiding "roving sensors" that will kill you. Basically a very simple puzzle game with some action elements, the random levels should help keep things somewhat interesting despite the games bland graphics and gameplay.

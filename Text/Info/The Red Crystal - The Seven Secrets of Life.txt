You are in the land Darkmoore which is reigned by the evil Lexnor. And because you are playing an RPG you have to defeat him. For this purpose you travel through Darkmoore to conquer dungeons and maximize your fame. You can choose between five  classes.

The screen is divided into two parts. On the left side is always our hero, the right side is reserved for various indexes like a map. This is, if you play alone. Quite unusually for RPGS of its time you can play the game with a friend - the second player is seen on the right side of the screen.

Before every fight you can try to bribe your enemy.

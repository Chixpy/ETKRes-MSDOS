Mad News is another German business-simulation. You are chief-editor of a boulevard-newspaper. With spectacular stories you try to push your newspaper edition (and your account). You also can earn money with commercials in your paper. Two other papers are in competition with you.

This is the unofficial sequel to Mad TV.

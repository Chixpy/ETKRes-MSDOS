The object of CASTLES & KINGS is to become the sole Ruler of the Realm. This is done by eliminating other contending Warlords and uniting the Kingdom under one Rule. This is not an easy task, as it requires players to use strategy, deception, and constant back stabbing to reach their goal. Sounds like fun eh?

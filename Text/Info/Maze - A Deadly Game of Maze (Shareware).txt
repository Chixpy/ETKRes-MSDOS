This game of Maze provides beautiful 3-Dimensional and top-down views of labyrinths and your human or computer opponent.  Sonar beeps tell you how close you are to your opponent: you must figure out how to negotiate the maze to get close enough to your opponent to fire.  If you are in danger of being destroyed then you can run away and recuperate.  Taunt your opponent with his cowardice for running away, or entice him into your trap, or send any message through the message box.

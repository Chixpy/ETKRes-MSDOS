The Lemming Original games are as nice as a man can wish, but there is something what became a standard in last years but what they miss. This is the level editor. Although it is strange, the original DMA level editor is not available to wide Lemmings players public. It was not distributed along with the game and during the years DMA did not release it, because it seemed them too difficult to handle . Strange, isn"t it? My own opinion is that it was (and is) just a "marketing tactic". But what can an ordinary player do when the international corporation"s policy is so restrictive? LemEdit gives You the helping hand and it will try to bring back the old Lemmings glory back on the light.

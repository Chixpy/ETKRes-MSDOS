"NINE-MAN MATRIX is a game of pure skill that may be played against another human or your own system. It features outstanding 3-D modeled graphics, Soundblaster support, and challenging 1 or 2 player modes.

1 - Placement Phase

Each player is given nine spheres of his color to be placed in small rings on the playfield. Between these rings are yellow bars set in a distinctive pattern.

Players alternate placing spheres until all are gone. If at any time, a player manages to align three spheres of his color along a yellow bar (which are only horizontal and vertical), he scores a ""mill"".

Scoring a mill, allows a player to remove any piece of his opponent"s that is not already part of a mill. This ball is discarded and is not returned to his opponent"s hand.

Once all spheres have been played, the game enters the second phase.

2 - Movement Phase

Alternately, players move a sphere of their color to any adjacent (connected by yellow bar) and vacant ring, in an effort to score mills.

Opponent"s pieces are removed from the board in the same manner as the first phase."

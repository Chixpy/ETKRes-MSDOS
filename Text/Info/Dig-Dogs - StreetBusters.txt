It"s time for road safety education. Learn how to drive economic, save and in accordance to the (German) traffic regulations, while trying to reach a certain parking area of the city within 10 minutes. The game lets you tune your car to show what parts are useful economically and which are not. Besides searching for the fastest course while keeping to the regulations, the game incorporates a bunch of mini-games that are triggered when you violate certain rules or if some problem with your car appears (empty car battery, broken exhaust pipe, damaged body parts, etc.). The three dogs, that are referenced by the game"s title, give useful hints and explain the perils and quirks in road traffic quite well. The mini-games include a jigsaw puzzle , as well as a Tetris variation, a reaction test and few more.

Cobra Mark IV multi-purpose General Contact Vehicle is an astonishing stellar vehicle. It"s got beam lasers mounted up front and at the rear and is loaded with missile launchers. It"s highly maneuverable and quick to react you your every move. Naturally a fighter like this will give you a great advantage. Unfortunately your opponent is flying the exact same thing. Quick reactions will determine the outcome of this duel in outer-space involving up to four opponents. Be careful of other ships flying about and mind those asteroids.

LineWars is an space-fighter sim that takes place in the far reaches of another galaxy. You control your ship via mouse or keyboard from a first person perspective. By using the number keys you can look around the different viewpoints of your ship and of course will have to do so to mount those rear beams. Your weapons are the aforementioned laser beams and missiles. The missiles only fire when locked on a target but the lasers can be used to blast meteors, passing law-abiding space ships and just to waste your energy. Your energy (shields) and lasers have a limited gauge. Once the gauge lowers to zero for your lasers you will have to wait a few seconds for them to refill. This naturally doesn"t apply to your energy. Once those babies come down it"s just a few inches of hull between you and oblivion. Missiles are limited to four shots but there is the off chance that your missile launcher will jam at which point you must engage in battle without them.

The game receives it"s name not from the linear polygonal graphics but from fighting "on-line". That is, phone line. Multi-player battles can be fought via modem between four players but there"s always the computer if friends are lacking. Settings of the game are adjustable in that you can select friction and speed at which you react and the number of opponents fighting.

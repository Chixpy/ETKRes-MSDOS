The object of the puzzle game WESP (originally in German) is to step on every square to remove it from the playing field. The game features many puzzles, and although the graphics and such are very basic, they do the job. The controls are slightly unintuitive, especially if (like me) you"re on a laptop without a numpad. Use the numbered arrow keys 1-9 to move ONE square at a time, and the regular arrow keys to move two at a time hopping over one square. At least, that"s how it works on my computer.

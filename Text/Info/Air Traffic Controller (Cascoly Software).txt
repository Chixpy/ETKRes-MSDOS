In this simulation the player takes on the role of an air traffic controller and safely guides the airplanes to their destinations!  This is an ASCII text-based game much like the later Atari ST game of the same name. Each plane on the screen is represented by a letter and arrow. A list off to the side lists all planes in the airspace, their location, destination, fuel, course, and altitude. The player must guide some planes to land at specific airports; other planes must be guided to specific exit points on the airspace boundaries.

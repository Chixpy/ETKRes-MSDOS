You are the pilot of an advanced TurboJet Fighter Aircraft. You must survive through five increasingly difficult levels of aerial combat, killing eight enemy spy satellites along the way. To complicate matters, there is an enemy cannon that will try to pick you off beginning in round 3. If you make it to round 4 the satellites decide to get some revenge, and start shooting back. Good Luck, and don"t forget: Shoot and Move!

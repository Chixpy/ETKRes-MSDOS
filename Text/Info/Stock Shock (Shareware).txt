"A stock is a share in the capital of a company. Corporations sell stocks to raise money, and people buy stocks to make money. The price of a stock usually varies with how well the company is doing financially overall. Your purpose in life as a stock market investor is to buy a stock while the price is low and sell the stock when the price is high. If you happen to own stock in a company that has gone chapter 11, you cannot sell that stock, since no one in their right mind will ever buy it. Your only hope is that the company pulls itself out of the hole. Otherwise, it will go bankrupt and you lose big time. If you happen to own a stock that splits, that means that the price of the stock has gone over a certain limit, and the price is therefore halved, and the number of shares you own is doubled. This is a good thing, since more shares means more money.

This program is a mock simulation, designed for those of you who think making money is fun. Stock Shock varies from real life in several ways. First, to allow 30 stocks to be displayed on the screen at once, I did away with the fraction prices, and simply used integers. Secondly, you can buy and sell as much of a stock as you want. In real life, you are limited by the number of shares available, etc. Finally, when a large number of shares of a company are bought in real life, the company tends to do better financially since it got the extra cash. Nothing doing in Stock Shock. This is not supposed to be a close simulation of the real market. Why? Realism is boring. Stock Shock has action, suspense and fun, not drab tickers and dull forecasts."

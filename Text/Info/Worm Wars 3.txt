Worm Wars 3 will look somewhat familiar to anyone who played the classic QBasic game Nibbles, but it includes many improvements and features that seperate it from Nibbles. It still uses ASCII graphics, but includes multiplayer play (versus another player or the computer) as well as powerups and new maps, as well as the ability to design your own maps. It plays quite well, and fans of snake-type games will find much to enjoy here.

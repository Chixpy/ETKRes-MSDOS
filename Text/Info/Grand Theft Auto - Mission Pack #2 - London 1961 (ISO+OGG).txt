London 1961 is the second mission pack for Grand Theft Auto. It has been made available as a free digital download and requires GTA: London 1969 in order to run. Also this expansion only works with the original disc of GTA London 1969, not with the one in the GTA: The Classics Collection.

The expansion adds new missions, 22 new vehicles, a new cutscene, and a new multiplayer deathmatch map based upon Manchester.

NOTA: Necesita la versi√≥n de DOSBox de Ykhwong.

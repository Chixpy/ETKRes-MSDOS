A text  action adventure game in the same vein as Diablo. Select from 5 character classes ( Paladin, Necromancer, Barbarian, Zen-Druid, Shadowy Tracker ) and explore the 3 levels of the dungeon Ebon Titan. If you make it to the end you face off against the boss Titan himself. The game mixes elements from classic text based adventure gaming like inventory based puzzle solving with more action oriented dungeon crawl style hack and slash game play. The game also employs a very simple top down ascii based graphical map of your surroundings in addition to the usual textual description and utilizes the PC speaker for simple battle sounds and the like.

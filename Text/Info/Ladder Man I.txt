Ladder Man is a puzzle game. Each screen depicts a room around which are scattered objects among which are diamonds that Ladder Man must collect. Once he has done this then the player must guide Ladder Man to the exit which leads to the next room.
Ladder Man"s ladder has a finite length and usually is not enough to reach the diamonds on its own. There are other objects in the room which will help him such as balls to stand on, blocks, ball holders, gondolas, and fire hydrants to quench fires. The puzzle is to use these objects correctly enabling Ladder Man to collect all the diamonds in the room in the minimum number of moves

The game holds a score card for up to five players.

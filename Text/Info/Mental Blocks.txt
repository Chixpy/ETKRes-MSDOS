Mental Blocks is essentially Tetris in 3D, similar to a better-known and superior game called Blockout.This is one of the rarest Accolade games, because the company was sued and later forced to pull the game from the market in a matter of months (probably due to too much similarities with Welltris, Spectrum Holobyte"s 3D follow-up to Tetris that was being released around the same time). Its unfortunate fate in the courtroom notwithstanding, Mental Blocks is a lot of fun and quite addictive, although the graphics are inferior to, and gameplay is not as smooth as, California Dreams" Blockout. Worth a look if you like Tetris clones, however. The game even has a decent AI that plays a pretty good game of Tetris all by itself in demo mode.

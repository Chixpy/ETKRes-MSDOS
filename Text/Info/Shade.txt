Shade is a text adventure game set in a single room, the protagonist"s dilapidated apartment, as you prepare for a visit to the Burning Man-alike Death Valley Om Festival in the desert.  The closer you get to being prepared to leave to the airport, the more problems befall you -- mundane ones at first, such as thirst and misplaced airplane tickets, and then, grain upon grain, a whole sandbox of more surreal ones suggesting that, as in the movie Jacob"s Ladder, not all is as it seems.

With your only, inert, companions a revealing desert guidebook, a helpful task list and an esoteric radio tuned to what must be a campus station, you must ply the hallucinatory depths of a failing brain"s rationalisations of its final few perceptions and determine if you"re going to take a stand or be taken by sand.

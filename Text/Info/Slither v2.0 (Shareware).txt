You, the poor snake, were plucked from the high desert and dumped into this drab experimental laboratory.  Did they ask you if you wanted a change in lifestyle?  Noooo.  You break out in no time (being a hyperintelligent snake) and start looking for a way out.  Fortunately there are plenty of goodies on the way to eat while you"re waiting for a door to open.  Can you make it out of the gigantic university hospital?  Can you survive the unrelenting assault of level after level of NON STOP PARANOIA??  Are you just trying to read the flipping rules and get on with it?  Read on...

Grow longer by maneuvering your snake around obstacles and eating (running into) the various goodies placed on the screen.  The first goodie is a nice fat rat.  Yum yum.  (Goodies get progressively stranger as the game goes on) Avoid hitting anything else, including yourself or other snakes.  

If you take too long getting to a goodie, it will begin to blink and eventually disappear (Strike one).  If you allow three goodies to disappear on a single level, the game is over.  In other words, three strikes and yer out!

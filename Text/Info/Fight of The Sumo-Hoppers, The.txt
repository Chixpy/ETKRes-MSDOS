The Fight of the Sumo-Hoppers is a bizarre sumo fighting game between the members of Gl\u00f6\u00f6tz-race on the planet of Musculia. Radioactive wrestlers weighing several megatons fight on a concrete desert in this ancient holy sport.

The game offers new freedom - and also responsibility - for the player. In classical budo games you merely chose the technique. In The Fight of the Sumo-Hoppers you must design and compose the technique of small elements (movements of the wrestlers foot) and finally perform it.

This DEMO program requires a 2 button mouse (Mircosoft will do), DOS and a VGA.

If the game runs too fast on your machine (we use ultra fast code) type shooter <n> where n is a number. (do not type brackets <>).

Larger numbers slow game down more.

Press space to bypass screens.

This is but one of many examples of Team Infinity"s DOS Games.

Others include Scrollers, Parallax, and platform games.

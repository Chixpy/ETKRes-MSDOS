Bert and the Snake is a clone of Q*Bert. Your character must jump on a grid of blocks arranged in a pyramid shape, avoiding the snake and other characters that randomly appear. A successful jump changes that block"s color. When you have hit all of the blocks on your current pyramid, you advance to the next level. Each level becomes increasingly difficult as the speed increases and more baddies are added into the mix. A high score table is included.

"The year is 2094, little has changed in the last 100 years. Technology continues to advance at a slow but steady rate. But a revolution is at hand! A recent paper published in an obscure journal has proven a method for modulating the conversion of energy to matter.

As an eminent scientist at the University of Dullsville, you immediately recgonize the importance of this finding. You hastily start designing a machine which will be able to make exact copies of anything you want, even copies of yourself! You work feverishly into the night to complete your design. At last you finish! Yes! Yes, it will work... you can indeed build a replicator.

But surely other scientists will have realized that they too can design replicators. There is no time for careful planning, no time to quitely gather the resources needed to build your replicator! You must strike out into the city tonight and take what you need. Today the City of Dullsville!... Tomorrow the world!

You activate the personal bodyguard that you build last year to display at the Eight Annual Conference on Synthetic Life Forms. The university chancellor had ordered it destroyed after it maimed several conference delegates, but you hid it for a day like this! Together you and your monster go out into the dark city... there is much work to be done!"

Okay everybody, now Majesty has something new to show off to you. Finally, Stunt Surfer 3.3 is at your electronic doorstep, awaiting you to play! 3.3 offers even more new stunts (6), and a few new ways to get more points. These will be explained later. For those of you who haven"t played 1.5 or 2.15, here is the basic idea: you are a surfer out going for high ratings against judges. Dazzle them with your high jumping, fantastic flips and other moves, and mabye they will award you with more honorful titles than "Baby Boarder!". Just go out there and show them what you"re made of, or compete with up to four friends in the tournament mode.

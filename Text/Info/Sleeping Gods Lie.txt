Sleeping Gods Lie combines elements of action and adventure-style gameplay. The entire game world is viewed from first person perspective, rendered in "fake" 3D. The player explores this world, finding items, solving occasional puzzles, and getting closer to the goal. Enemies will often attack the hero; the key to victory is usually the power of the weapon the hero wields. These can be melee weapons as well as long-ranged ones such as a slingshot. Combat is entirely action-oriented. The game has an internal clock, and the hero can get tired and will have to rest from time to time.

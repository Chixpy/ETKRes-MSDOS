Paladin 1 and 2 are Omnitrend"s application of the complex tactical engine that underlies its underrated Breach games to the fantasy universe of knights, monsters, and damsels in distress.The result is a unique blend of RPG and strategy that unfortunately gets bogged down by too much detail (e.g. to move a character you"ll need to first "face" him in the right direction). The lack of a larger plot also diminishes play value to RPGers, while the addition of spells and magical items seem more of an afterthought than an integral part of the game.

In this legal simulation, the player is in charge of a defense attorney in a criminal trial, mounting relevant objections against the prosecution"s badgering of a series of key witnesses toward issuing skewed testimony in a case against your defendant, accused of murdering one Sandra Stiff, a glamourous Beverly Hills heiress. It is not enough to know when one may mount an objection, but specifically which from eleven different categories (from argumentative to hearsay to immaterial. Once in a while a legitimate question comes through and the player still needs to identify it as a proper question!)

This game has since been re-made for Windows with enhanced graphics and citation from case law.

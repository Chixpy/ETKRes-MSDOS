Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Adventure is an enjoyable foray into the sciences for the enquiring mind. Suitable either for the child or child at heart, it covers numerous subjects.

Navigable either by a world globe in the upper left hand corner or by a \u201cLibrary Cabinet\u201d that is accessed by a button on the upper right, it takes the user on a tour of various topics as explained by the late, great Isaac Asimov. Easy-to-understand text and vivid VGA graphics unite to make this program a good starting point for a venture into various disciplines. Ideal for younger children who can read on their own, as the word choice is simple and easy to follow.

 The interface is not particularly intuitive; it makes one long for tooltips and an instruction booklet. The navigation isn\u2019t as simple as it could be; the links between various bits of information could be more clear. But apart from that, the graphics are well done and the layout is well defined. The sound is also a nice touch.

The \u201cgame\u201d section of this title is quite frustrating; a clue is given and the user has to find the screen on which said clue is mentioned. The invention of pottery, for instance. Or printing. It\u2019s not really something that\u2019ll hold the attention of most children, and could definitely have been improved on.

I give this game 3.5 out of 5.

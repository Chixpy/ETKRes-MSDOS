Sea Dragon is an arcade style side scrolling shooter. You pilot a submarine through treacherous underwater caves in an attempt to destroy a heavily guarded reactor. Mines, gun turrets, and a variety of enemies make the mission very difficult! The submarine is armed with missiles, torpedoes, and a "Big Kill" weapon (this affects everything onscreen) to help in your mission. The air supply is limited, so when possible you will need to surface to replenish your air supply.

Reflector Chess is a two player strategy game that involves bouncing projectiles off mirrors whilst trying to destroy your opponent\u2019s pieces. It is similar to chess in that players take turns moving their pieces around a board, but the similarities stop there. Each person starts the game with a Mothership, two Baby Ships, and a number of mirrors, Beam Splitters, and Shields. The objective of the game is to destroy the other player\u2019s Mother Ship.

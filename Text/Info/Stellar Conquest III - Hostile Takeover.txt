Stellar Conquest 3 is a shareware game. The goal of the game is to destroy your enemies starbases. In order to do this, you must mine stars, build warships, scout for the enemy, and then do battle. There are three different weapons which can be built on a ship, all with different damage, accuracy and range. In addition, there are torpedoes which can be fired at any point on the map, regardless of distance, but they are very innacurate. The controls are completely mouse driven, and are extremely easy to use.

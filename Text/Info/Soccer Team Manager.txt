Your primary role is to manage a soccer team, and watch as they develop after each match, which earns or loses you money, without ever seeing or taking part in on field action.

Chose from British and Italian football leagues to custom your own team from selection of top players to hire, fire or exchange with another club. Decisions made will determine their success, chose poorly and it reflects in the overall results. To help in the process, you can review their salaries and receive weekly financial information after a game. 

Pick avenue for your team to play, some are more expensive then others as are the top teams you play against. A good crowd turn out helps to boast profits as you gain a percentage of total ticket sales.

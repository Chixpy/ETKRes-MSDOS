Ski King 2 is a downhill ski game and sequel to Ski King. You have to race as quickly as possible down the hill and at the same time avoid all of the obstacles in the hill. The trees from the first game are not the only obstacles, there are rocks, water and billboards too. And to make the game more interesting jumps has been added. There are two game modes: Pro hill and Endless. In Pro hill mode there are 50 hills and for every 10 hills you get past you get an extra life. In endless mode you just ski for as long as you can. The hills are generated randomly so no race is the same.

This was, at the time, one of the few modem-to-modem multiplayer games available. It"s basically a simple maze game using Battletech-style robots. Megatron VGA is multi-player capable using phone modems (good luck with that) or you can also play against a computer opponent. The graphics were pretty good at the time, and there is sound, but the gameplay itself is very limited. The 3D-like maze moves a block at a time, not smoothly, and there is not much strategy involved to win.

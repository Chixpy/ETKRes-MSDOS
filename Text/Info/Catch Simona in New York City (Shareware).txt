Carmen Sandiego was a little fish in a big pond -- gallivanting through enormous settings such as the USA, the World and, yea, Time itself, with her sinister and avaricious criminal plots.  Simona is a chip off the old block, but prefers to pillage without having to mess with luggage and those tricky time zone differences: her criminal predations are restricted solely to the Big Apple.  It"s a big city, there"s plenty to steal.

This clone plays much like its bigger sisters; you go from site to site interrogating witnesses hoping to uncover sufficient clues to both point to the suspect"s next location and to gather the evidence needed to issue a warrant for their arrest.

This tactical wargame/adventure is based on the GDW pencil and paper role-playing game. NATO and Warsaw Pact forces spent the latter part of the 1990s fighting a brutal war, which has turned Poland into a desolate radiation-riddled land, full of abandoned vehicles and weapons. The maniacal Baron Czarny wants to take over what"s left of the country; you must stop him.

The player must organize a team of 20 generated soldiers, each of whom will respond to orders differently, based on their personality. Specific abilities, attributes and languages spoken can be set. 

Action from within the vehicles is shown in 3D, outside action is viewed top-down. Both aspects of the game require meticulous planning around the game"s range of weapons and vehicles. Help can be received from NPCs, via the game"s communication system.

Captain Kang is a platform shooter starring the titular character, a kangaroo who also happens to be a special agent sent on a mission to protect a city populated by anthropomorphic animals from a monster assault. The Captain is equipped with his default laser pistol at all times. He can shoot in two directions, jump, and duck. Kang"s health is measured by a bar with separate units; collecting a sufficient amount of giant pills and other items scattered through the stages will refill a portion of the bar. Temporary invincibility power-up is also available. The stages are fairly vast and may offer optional routes to the destination.

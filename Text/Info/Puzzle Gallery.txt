The "sequel" of sorts to The Fool"s Errand, Cliff Johnson wasn"t at his best in this puzzle collection designed around the "carnival" theme (the game takes a sardonic look at the amusement park biz through Johnson"s eyes as a former employee), but that"s not to say the game isn"t good-- it *is* a good collection of puzzles of many types, although none as original as those in its prequel.Still, there are a few pleasant surprises and good twists lurking among the anagrams, jigsaws, and other well-known parlor puzzles. 

Note: In 2002, designer Cliff Johnson put up the superior Mac version for download at his website, to cheers of fans worldwide. You can download it from his site in "Related Links" area below. Thanks, Cliff!

Rival plays chess and chess variants.  Rather than take the sensible approach and allow you to operate the program via drop down menus, Rival uses icons, great big chunky ICONS.  We"ll leave it up to you to decide if this was a good idea or not but Russ spent a lot of time  drawing those icons so please try to love "em!  We"re very pleased with the way it looks, and once you"ve figured out where everything is and what it does, you may well find Rival a lot easier to use than if it used words and stuff.

As well as playing a respectable game of chess, Rival plays various variant games using the regular chess pieces (see "Rules For Variant Games"). Very shortly, Rival will be able to play half a dozen or more variant chess games, at present it plays only tow, Kinglet and Giveaway chess.

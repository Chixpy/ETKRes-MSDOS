Arcade Trivia Quiz is a trivia gameshow featuring many questions from various categories.Although it supports up to three players, playing solo is interminably boring, since there is no computer players-- unless you like to compete against yourself :) The game is very entertaining when you can get friends to play with, although only hotseat mode is offered. Gameplay is very similar to standard trivia gameshows on TV: pick a category, then choose the right answer before time runs out. Right answers will add money to your stash, and wrong ones will subtract from it. Even with a limited number of categories, Arcade Trivia Quiz"s vibrant graphics, fast gameplay, and a good selection of questions make it a good parlor games to play among friends on a rainy night. Recommended, especially to fans of movies and music given the focus of most categories.

Rimtrix is an interesting combination of Pipe Dream (and its numerous knock-offs such as Antrun) and picture sliding puzzles. The goal is to direct the ball through the the pipes into the appropriately colored cup on the other side of the board. It"s harder than it sounds! You have to move the pieces and also rotate them in order to try to keep the ball moving. The bland CGA graphics don"t really hurt the game although they may strain your eyes after awhile.

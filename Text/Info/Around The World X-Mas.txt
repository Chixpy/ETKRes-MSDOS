Since the first release of Around the World we have got many e-mails from people who liked the game - but had improvements. Some of these suggestions have been inplented in this Christmas version, a version that doesn"t include the old versions, and it"s therefore a whole new game. -And remember, this software is EMAILWARE, which means you should email us with comments. You don"t have to do this, but you should. And if you do, you will be registered as a registered user (wow!)

NOTA: Este perfil utiliza la versi√≥n de DOSBox de ykhwong.

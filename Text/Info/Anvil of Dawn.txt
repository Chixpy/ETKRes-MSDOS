Anvil of Dawn was one of the last "non 3D" first person role-playing games (i.e. Eye of the Beholder). 

The player starts out by picking from one of five characters (two female, two male and one lizard!). The player then proceeds to training with a wizard who teaches the player a basic spell in the discipline of the player"s choice (earth, wind, fire, water, lightning). The party then sets off on a quest to destroy an evil warlord. The adventure will take the player through castles, dungeons and shipwrecks.

This simulation allows players to throw darts at a virtual board by hitting the space bar three times at critical moments.  The first hit determines where the dart is aimed on a horizontal plane, the second determines the angle of the throw and the third determines the strength of the throw.  The object of the game is to run out of points; points are lost by successfully hitting the dart board.  Players cannot score until they have "doubled in" by hitting a double scoring area, and they must "double out" by hitting a double scoring area worth exactly the right amount of points in order to reduce their score to zero.  The starting point value and the speed of the program can be adjusted.

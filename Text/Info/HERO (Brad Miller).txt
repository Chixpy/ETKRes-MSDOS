Offering role-playing (rpg) in a world of medieval / fantasy, Hero is an abandonware developed by Brad Miller and published by Brad Miller. Released in 1999, you wander around in a top-down perspective.

From Brad Miller, the game creator :

This game is cardware. If you enjoy playing it, then you should register your copy by sending a postcard to me, the author. If you think this game sucks, then either delete it or give it to someone you don\u2019t like. I\u2019m happy to receive any kind of comments you may have, so don\u2019t hesitate to send me a sentence or two about why I should discontinue my programming hobby...

Right now, you might be thinking \u2019Why cardware?\u2019. Lets just say that it would make the many hours of programming that I put into making this game worth it just to get a postcard from someone who played (and possibly even enjoyed) \u2019HERO\u2019. Also, I\u2019ve kind of realized that a 16 color, soundless, EGA game probably won\u2019t make very much money no matter what I do (unless, that is, I can somehow find a clever way to transport it to the late 1980\u2019s). Despite this, however, I think that if you give \u2019HERO\u2019 an honest chance, you may learn to like it.

If this turns out to be the case, then write your name, address, a description of how you found this game, and your opinion of it onto a postcard (or letter) and send it to:

Brad Miller
1933 Country Club Road
Fairmont, West Virginia 26554

If you\u2019ve beaten the game, then put down some stuff about your character as well, such as the character class and special abilities you used, items you found that you thought were cool, your final score, etc. Any comments, suggestions, criticisms, bug reports, and appraisals that you might have should also be sent my way. If you think that something is amiss with the copy you have received, or if you\u2019d like a more recent version, just drop me a line and I\u2019ll see to it that you get a fresh copy for free. Finally, if you\u2019d like to distribute this game, just make sure that all of the original files get shipped as\u2014is (and send me a postcard telling me what you\u2019re doing).

Thanks, and happy gaming...

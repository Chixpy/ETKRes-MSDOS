Oil"s Well is a computer game distributed by Sierra On-Line in 1983, and remade in 1990. The game was programmed by Thomas J. Mitchell and Bill Sargent. Bill Sargent went on to work on such projects as The Sims, and SimCity 2000.

The player attempts to manage an oil drilling operation and collect oil, while evading subterranean creatures. The player can advance through eight different levels, using four directional control buttons to move the drill head, and pressing a button to quickly retract it.

The game was released for multiple platforms including the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, MSX, ColecoVision, and IBM compatibles.

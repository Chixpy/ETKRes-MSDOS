Super Beemger is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls a transformer spaceship, fighting mechanical and organic aliens in deep space and their bases. The game"s defining feature are the ship"s special moves, which are executed by pressing down a button. Among these moves is mecha transformation, energy recharge, an offensive shield, and a powerful attack that destroys all the enemies on screen. All these moves deplete a special energy bar, which gradually refills itself. The player can select between three fire rates, which influence the speed of the regeneration.

When in mecha form the ship can fire straight and spreading shots typical for shoot-em-ups. However, the normal form relies exclusively on homing weapons that hit multiple enemies but cannot target individual enemies directly. Switching between these two forms is essential to survival.

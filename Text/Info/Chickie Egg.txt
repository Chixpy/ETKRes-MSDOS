This remake of a somewhat obscure computer game features pseudo-3D "rendered" graphics which were all the rage for awhile back in the early/mid 90"s in games such as Alone in the Dark. This game has nothing to do with Alone in the Dark though. It"s a fairly generic item grabbing game, the object is to move your guy who seems to be wearing a tomato costume around the screen, avoiding the ostrich-like bird enemies. Strangeness aside, this game does have some control issues (too tough to move around) but they"re not large enough to kill the fun entirely.

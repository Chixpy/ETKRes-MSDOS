A bunch of prisoners have escaped from a prison bus and you, as the Sheriff"s deputy, must take them out.  Unfortunately, they have had help in escaping, and have been supplied with guns.  Blood Bath at Red Falls is a shooting gallery game where the enemies are digitized actors who pop up from behind cover on the different screens. You can shoot for other items including ammo, a better gun, extra hits and lives. Be careful not to shoot innocent hostages who might get in the way. There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Bring it on, and Bad Ass.

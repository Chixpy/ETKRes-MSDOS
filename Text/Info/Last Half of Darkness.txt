Last Half of Darkness is an adventure game that takes place entirely in and around a haunted mansion, complete with graveyards, crypts and foreboding swamps. The graphics in the game consist of a collection of still images. The main screen is divided into five major sections: the game world, inventory, list of exits, commands, and a description box at the bottom. The player has to position the mouse on a command (Move, Examine, Take and Operate) and left-click to perform that action. The game is available in both EGA and 256-color VGA mode.

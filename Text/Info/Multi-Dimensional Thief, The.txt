"The MULTI-DIMENSIONAL THIEF is an AAAA (Absolutely Awesome Adventure from Australia) game. Full of clever and irreverent humo(u)r, it will remind you of the best from Infocom and from Douglas Adams. Has build-in ""pop-up"" hints. Requires 512K of memory and 720K of disk space. PostCardWare.

To run, just type THIEF at the DOS prompt -- and enjoy."

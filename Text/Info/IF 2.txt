IF 2 contains three separate scenarios (as opposed to four of the previous game); they are numbered 5, 6, and 7 (continuing the count from the first IF), but have no relation story-wise either to the preceding scenarios or each other.

"Scenario 5" is a rare example of "mainstream" eroge which deals with a male homosexual relationship. The adult content here is text-only; there are no graphics that depict explicit sex. The hero of the game is a young man who lives together with his boyfriend. A girl who works with him in the company seems fancy him, and the protagonist has to deal with her advances and his partner"s jealousy, questioning his own orientation in progress.

This scenario has a branching story line; the premise is that the hero, a college student, is desperate to find a date. The episode is dedicated only to one day of the hero"s life; during this day, he must locate and convince a girl to have a date with him. Depending on the player"s choices, the story develops in various different directions from there.

The final, "seventh" scenario stars a female protagonist, a high-school student named Kumi. One night she dreams of her male classmate having a romantic relationship with her. Upon arriving in the school, however, she sees another girl obviously trying to seduce the man of her dreams. Will she be able to reclaim him for herself - and if so, by what means?..

The gameplay in IF 2 is similar to that of the previous game, though the branching story line concept is somewhat deeper and more complicated. There are more choices to make, and they have a more significant impact on the development on the story. Particularly the second episode is notable for being more open-ended, but also unforgiving and leading to premature endings if the player doesn"t choose the right things to do and/or to say.

An enhanced version of Arcanum"s original Mahjong solitaire game. The game calls itself as "Dragons Bane" everywhere except for one instance of "Dragon"s Bane" on the title screen. Mah Jongg II upgrades Mah Jongg"s EGA graphics to VGA and SVGA, and adds animation and sound effects when pairs of tiles are removed. You can also choose from a number of backgrounds, board layouts and tile sets. The bells and whistles can be turned off if you prefer a more meditative experience. The game also tells you when you run out of moves by default and includes a timer. The registered version includes additional tile sets and layouts.

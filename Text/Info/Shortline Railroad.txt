Shortline is an excellent beer-and-pretzel realtime railroad management game that eschews complicated financial aspects (as in A-Train) and all realistic factors in favor of the pure joy of creating a miniature railroad.You goal is to assure an uninterrupted collision-free passage of different trains to target points, and your success both in traffic dispatch and railroad management and construction determines your score. It"s a lot of fun, and quite addictive :)

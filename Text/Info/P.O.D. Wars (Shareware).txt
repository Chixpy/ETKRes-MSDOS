"The comfortized society of the late 2100s can be quite boring. Apart from the attacks on earth by the Zonrins some fifty years ago, there has been only technological changes for over one hundred years. There is very little challenge in day to day living. This has lead some of the more adventuresome to equip their Personal Observation Droids (PODS) with lasers and impulse cannons and send them out in search of the precious metal Qzrn (pronounced Cues-rin). Though originally designed for personal long distance exploration, the PODS have proven quite capable when carefully supplied and piloted. The Zonrins, now fierce enemies of Earth, have secured all known Qzrn in various space colonies on Zonar. They have built extensive fortified areas often guarded by automated ZPods armed with shield damaging impulse cannons.

Sending your POD to Zonar ties up one of your ships for an extended period of time and risks the loss of the POD and supplies. But this may be the only excitement and challenge you will experience in the last one hundred years of your life. Sure it will cost you millions, but the reward for a successful journey is billions. Besides, it is worth it even if you lose a POD. These ventures of conflict on Zonar have come to be known as the POD WARS. No one seems to be concerned enough to try to stop them. Besides, earth needs the Qzrn.

To win the game you must locate the precious metal Qzrn, using your highly modified Personal Observation Droid. You will be able to use the laser to cut through some walls and bombs to blast through others. The Smart Cannon is effective against the enemies ZPod automated sentries. Power cells may be found to maintain your POD"s energy level. When the power is all gone, the game is over. You may save your game position to be re-loaded later. "

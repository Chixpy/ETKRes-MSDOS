The Burps is a former shareware, now freeware clone of Ultimate"s Atic Atac, with improved graphics, sounds and new level design. As in the original 1983 game, the player selects one of three characters trapped inside a haunted castle, each with unique weapons and routes through the maze-like building.

The main objective is to explore the map and find the key for the entrance door. Dangerous ghosts and other supernatural beings materialize on each room, milling around the character to drain some health energy. The energy meter is presented as a roasted chicken that is slowly consumed until only its bones remain on the plate. The lost energy can be restored by picking up random food items scattered around the screen. Useful items like keys can also be collected and stored on three slots at the top interface to open new passages and solve puzzles. Trapdoors and staircases give access to other floors.

No relations to the similar-named Infocom game (Mechwarrior), MechWar is almost a direct port of the popular FASA board game featuring futuristic mechs.Despite being an unauthorized version, Mechwar includes almost all the mechs that fans will immediately recognize. To get the most out of the game, you have to be a fan of Battletech series, and can put up with non-flashy graphics. 

All the detail inherent in the board game is here, including armor types and the ability for the meches to use their limbs to damage other mechs-- a feature absent from all the latest giant robot games except Metal Fatigue. Now to the bad points (which luckily this game doesn"t have too many of). Firstly, there is no AI of any kind, so you have to play with a friend or yourself. I actually play it on my own, and I still think it is one of the most enjoable Battletech games I have ever played -- no doubt owing to the game being a very faithful rendition of the board game. Another downside is that there is hardly any premade battles, but the game compensates for this with a versatile level maker, which is very easy to use even lets you design your own mechs and pilots. There is a newer version of this game (version 2 - see Related Link below), but it doesn"t have any mechs, and seems to have been abandoned years ago. Overall, MechWar is a top-notch game, and I highly recommend this to any Battletech fans. Thumbs up!

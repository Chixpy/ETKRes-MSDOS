In this third installment of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective your task is to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogues and reading the in the package included mock London newspapers. Once you have gathered enough evidence, you have to present your case in court and answer all of the judge\u2019s questions correctly. The three cases are:

* The Solicitous Solicitor

This case involves the sudden death of Melvin Tuttle, a solicitor who apparently has died of a heart attack. You are visited by Inspector Lestrade, who believes that Tuttle was murdered, poisoned to be exact.

* The Banker"s Final Debt

This case involves the murder of Oswald Mason at his home. Scotland Yard believes that the murder was a result of Mason disturbing a burglar, but the Treasury wants you to investigate the case as Mason was dealing with sensitive Treasury work at the time. 

* The Thames Murders

This case requests your assistance in solving five murder cases in which the bodies are all found on the bank of the Thames, this at first being the only thing linking the murders.

A small game based on old Warner Brothers cartoons. You play "Elmo Fuld" in pursuit of a certain rascally rabbit. Game structure provides an illusion of freedom, even though the puzzles can only be solved in linear sequence. Features cartoon physics (ie, you can walk off a cliff and hang in the air unsupported for a while.) Doesn"t really capture the feel of the cartoons, but that"s a given for any text-based medium.

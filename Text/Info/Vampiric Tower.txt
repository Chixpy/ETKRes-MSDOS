The player controls a comely purple-haired lady vampire, collecting vials of blood through fifty rooms (ten per level).  A given room can"t be traversed until all the blood is collected, the portcullis opening to the next chamber.  The path ahead and upward is not without obstacles however -- the rooms are filled with pushable blocks (get it out of your way -- but not into a place where it will obstruct access to the blood!), spikes that can"t be walked on, as well as numerous spooky enemies whose unimpeded line-of-sight gaze is lethal.  To help in traversing some of these hazards, as a vampire the player has a limited amount of transformations at their disposal -- the bat can fly over the spikes and around urns, but has to return to human form in order to collect the vials.  The puzzles become progressively more elaborate as the player advances through the tower, and new properties of blocks and spikes must be factored into the player"s careful planning.

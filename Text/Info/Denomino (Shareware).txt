Denomino is a single player, shareware, word building game for DOS.

In this game the player uses domino-like tiles to build words. Each tile contains two pairs of letters. The player makes words by positioning their tile next to an existing tile so that one or more four letter words are made. The game takes place on a twelve by twelve grid. Points are scored based on the values on the dominoes and whether the tile covers a bonus square. The game is entirely mouse controlled. Tiles are dragged & dropped onto the game area. The right mouse button moves the tile in a vertical position while the left rotates the tile 90 degrees so that it can be dropped in its horizontal position.

There are three types of game available.

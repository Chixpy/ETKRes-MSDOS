Bandit is a slot machine game. You start with $200 and you can play for $1 to $9 each time, by pressing the appropriate number key. After pulling the lever, three reels start to spin and when they stop you can see whether or not you have won money. You have won when the reels stop at a specific combination. For example when you see the word "Jackpot" three times, you have won the jackpot. The longer you play, the higher the jackpot will be.

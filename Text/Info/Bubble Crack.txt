Bubble Crack is a variant of Bust-A-Move, minus its cute trademarked mascots. Like its inspiration, this game concerns itself for the player aiming and launching (within ten seconds, at which point launch automatically occurs) a coloured sphere up a narrow tunnel, ricocheting appropriately to (ideally) latch on to other spheres of the same colour -- whereupon reaching bunches of three, they disappear.  Meanwhile, the "ceiling" periodically lowers (every six shots), gradually pushing each level"s default and accumulated mass of bubbles closer to the launcher at the bottom; if they descend past it, the player loses a life and starts the level over again.

Run with a special command-line switch -s, the game features power-up bubbles with special properties, and new level layouts can be designed solely through the use of a text editor.

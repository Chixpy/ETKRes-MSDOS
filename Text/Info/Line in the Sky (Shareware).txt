"Defend your cities against enemy attack by destroying their missiles, planes, and bombs before they land. The left and right mouse buttons fire missiles which explode when they reach where the cursor was when the missile was launched. Each attack wave ends when all enemy missiles, bombs and planes are destroyed. A bonus is awarded for the number of cities alive and the number of your missiles remaining. Bonus cities are awarded every 50,000 points. The game ends when all of your cities are destroyed.

When an enemy plane is destroyed it drops a parachute. Shooting this parachute awards special weapons. These include more missiles, faster missiles, or an ultra-bomb. The ultra bomb is fired by pressing both mouse buttons at the same time, and instantly destroys all enemy targets on the screen. The word BOMB will flash in the center of the data screen when you have an ultra-bomb available."

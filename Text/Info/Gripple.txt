The author claims that this simple color-matching puzzle game is based on an old pocket game of the same name by a company called "M-Squared Incorporated". I can verify this fact, because I own the very same (annoying) game. :) Actually it"s not a bad game at all. Basically you match colors by rotating the pieces around ... look at the screenshot and you"ll see what I mean. As usual with puzzle games, poor graphics, no sound, etc. but it might be a fun diversion for puzzle fans.

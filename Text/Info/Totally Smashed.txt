A LORD clone with somewhat meager backstory and character motivation, this BBS door puts the protagonist (that"s you, bub) in a wicked near-future town where a mysterious force is possessing the residents and compelling them to conduct unsavory and anti-social activities, most of which involve brutal hand weapons with decidedly silly names.

The solution to the town"s problems involves your engaging these deranged townsfolk in serial and repetitive single-keypress combats and attempting to decipher obscene menu options scrawled using entirely high-ASCII characters never intended to be used in the place of letters -- but they are fitting nonetheless for such unusual RPG options as <tt>[T]ake a Dump</tt> (see trivia) and <tt>[Z]lap your Monkey</tt>

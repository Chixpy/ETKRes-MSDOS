21 for 1 to 4 is a very simple blackjack card game for 1 to 4 players (as the name implies).Nothing much to say about this one, except that it?s worth mention as one of the earliest games included on SoftDisk?s ?Big Blue Disk? monthly on-disk publication that pioneered the use of shareware as a viable business model. The graphics are CGA only, but more than adequate to tell the different cards apart. If you have a few minutes to waste with a decade-old card game, check this oldie out.

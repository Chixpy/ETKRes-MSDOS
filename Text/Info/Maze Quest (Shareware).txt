Welcome to World Quest [Swizzle"s Note: This is what it says in the introduction when the game is titled Maze Quest...]!  You look like a hearty adventurer - come join the quest.

You have traveled far to arrive at a world where swordsmanship and magic are necessary skills for survival.  Many dire monsters and evil beings walk the land.  The maze itself is known to be full of snakes and rats; and other creatures less mundane.

But be not disheartened by the threat of monsters, for treasures there are aplenty.  Gold can be used to buy supplies and to improve your armor and weapons.  It has even been rumored that magical items are available in larger cities.

In The Worlds of Billy a boy named Billy has to cross 100 arcade levels to get back home. But of course there are bad guys who wants him dead and in this case the culprits are fruits. To get rid of them Billy has to dig holes in the ground and whack them with his hammer when they fall in - similar to Lode Runner. 

In the levels are several goodies to find, e.g. tennis balls which can be thrown at the enemies or bombs which decreases time needed to dig a hole. There are five worlds with different themes like a building site, caves or Egyptian ruins. The player has to beat a whole world before he can save the game.

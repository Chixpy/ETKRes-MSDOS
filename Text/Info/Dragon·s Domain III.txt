"Welcome to The Dragon"s Domain III!! This game was inspired by ADVENTURE on the Atari game systems ages ago. The concepts and goals are quite simple indeed, but actually accomplishing it is a different matter. You will have to face many perils in your quest. 3 great dragons are waiting to stomp on you, and many other creatures guard key points in your quest, including skeletons, fire elementals, ogres, ghosts, and more. (Sound"s familiar, eh?)

The graphics are still a vector-based design (but stored in a bitmap-like array), as with the previous games. --===Dragon"s Domain IV===-- will have more detail in the background using bitmaps, and the new graphics system will be MUCH faster (meaning less flicker! And not as much ""slow down"" on slower computers!).

To all of you who think a decent game absolutely must have scanned oil-paintings, high-res, ultra-colorful, mega-detailed, high-speed graphics, all in one package in order to be fun, I think this game and it"s successors will prove you wrong. It is not a combat-based game (although it has plenty of fighting to go around). It is a path finding/labyrinth/puzzle/strategy game. You will find many challenges. There is much strategy involved in slaying those pesky evil dragons. You will need to find your way through the mazes, and discover what items will aid or hurt you in your quest. The task is not easy. Your best friends will be your weapon, and the save-game feature."

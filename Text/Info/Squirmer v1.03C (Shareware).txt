Squirmer is on the rampage.  He has a voracious appetite for power pellets and he"ll stop at nothing before he consumes everything in sight!  The more he eats the more Suirmer grows, and the more points you earn, so munch away. Watch out for those nasty TNT bombs or you"ll blow him up in a chain reaction! The maze can get hectic at times.  Gobble an alarm clock if you start to run out of time, but don"t panic or you may never make it out alive!

Daymare 2 (apparently Daymare 1 was for the Atari ST computer) is a traditional first person RPG. Although it looks simplistic it does include some nice features, like an auto-generated map and mouse control. There"s not much story (you are supposed to kill an evil wizard or something) but if you enjoy old-school RPG type games you"ll probably find a lot to like here.

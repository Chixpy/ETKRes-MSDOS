One of the first games produced in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Sobor is a beat-em-up featuring Russian peasants engaging in bitter hand-to-hand combat through their quest to defeat "Evil Forces", protecting the knowledge that was found contained in ancient scrolls describing Russian Sobor combat system.

The game is broken into stages alternating object courses and combat. The player controls the group of five fighters. In the very first stage they are trained in a sparring session, the player"s performance defining their toughness for the rest of the game.  

Obstacle stages involve passing by the Baba Yaga and other characters of the Russian folklore, or navigating a grid of lightning-shooting skulls.

The core of the game, however, is five-on-five brawls, where the player controls one of the fighters while other four are controlled by AI. The player can switch the controlled fighter at any time.

A good top-down action / RPG that recalls classic Gauntlet, Storm lets one or two players explore the dungeons in search of treasures and exotic weapons.It offers straight-forward dungeon hack-and-slash without bothering with detailed statistics, and everything here has really been done better by other companies. Good for nostalgia once in a while.

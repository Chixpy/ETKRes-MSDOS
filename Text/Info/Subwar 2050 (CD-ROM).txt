Subwar 2050 (base game)
Subwar 2050: The Plot Deepens (add-on)

The year is 2050. Ocean is the next frontier, and war inevitably reached there. As an independent mercenary working for a corporate conglomerate, the player has to pilot the latest fighter subs to protect the corporate interests, so they can get rewarded with cold hard cash. With 5 different theater of operations (of varying difficulty) and an interesting mix of aerial and submarine tactics, this game can be described as Strike Commander under the sea, without the narrative.

An expansion disk for Subwar 2050, The Plot Deepens features a few new subs and weapons across three new campaigns: The Bermuda Triangle, The Mediterranean and The North Cape.

In each of these campaigns, you"ll be launching your attack sub from it"s home carrier to protect the interests of multinational corporations engaged in mining, research and development under the sea.

This is a flight simulator which uses a slightly modified version of the RealSpace engine from Strike Commander. You play a World War 2 pilot and get to fly in various historic missions such as dogfights, bombing runs and missile attacks, many of which are based on real battles. The US and Japanese planes of the time, and their weapons, are brought to life. 

One thing that makes Pacific Strike unique is that rather than a simple retelling of historical battles, the course of World War II is affected by the player. Failing to destroy particular targets will ensure that they remain problems in future missions, and doing extremely well will allow the allies to be more successful. Thus regardless of the actual course of the war, events unfold. For this reason it"s possible to  can end the war prematurely before Hiroshima was bombed or end up in a situation where American forces surrender to the Japanese.

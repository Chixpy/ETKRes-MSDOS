Pinball Fantasies Deluxe is a compilation of two previously released Digital Illusions pinball titles:

1) Pinball Fantasies: After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones "n" Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.

2) Pinball Mania: Digital Illusions was not involved in the fourth title in 21st Century"s pinball series, with this version instead being developed by veteran pinball game producers Spidersoft. 

Four tables are featured: Kick Off centres around soccer/football, Jail Break is set in a prison, Tarantula reflects Spidersoft"s name and logo as it features a rampant spider, and Jackpot is based around gambling.

There are sequences of lights to activate, ramps to guide the ball through, and flippers to keep it in play. Multiball can be activated in set ways, to bring a second ball into play. The flippers are not as powerful as in previous games in the series.

DentureMan is a strange clone/reworking of the classic Pacman dot-eating game. The playing field scrolls as you (disembodied teeth) proceed to eat all of the dots (toothpaste?) and avoid the ... uh, things. There are three different levels you can play in the shareware version, and while DentureMan offers decent (yet weird) graphics it doesn"t really improve the basic Pacman formula.

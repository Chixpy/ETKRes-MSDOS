All the very good Chess players are fond of playing a roomful of opponents simultaneously.  It sharpens their game (and their egos).

SIMULtaneous Player is a roomful of world-class players ready to test your ability to handle the intricacies of the opening game.

"SIMUL" is quite intuitive and doesn"t need detailed explanations
 to get you airborne.  You will get the hang of it very quickly.

"SIMUL" uses lines played over-the-board in important tournaments staged within the last few years.  This is the rough-and-tumble of actual tournament play.   See if you can survive the openings!

The program gives you the choice of White or Black and random or pre-selected opening moves.  Just like the real exhibition match.

If you falter, you will be told what the experts actually played.

And when the smoke clears you can get a printout of how you did.

Some of you will no doubt feel that you have discovered a hitherto unknown line or two.  Check it out by hitting the books and if you think it deserves more investigation then test it against a better player.  That"s how Chess players learn!

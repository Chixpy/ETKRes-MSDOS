Kix is an arcade style video game for the PC similar to the old Taito arcade game Qix.  Using your stylus, you attempt to draw areas on the game board without getting caught by the Kix or other opponents.  You complete a level after you have claimed a certain percentage of the total board.  Higher levels have wilder Kix;  eventually you must deal with two Kix!  Requires a fast 286 PC or better with VGA.

Whale"s Voyage II: Die \u00dcbermacht is the sequel to Whale"s Voyage. The story takes place 20 years after the crew of the spaceship Whale had won a battle and became heroes. Now all of the money has been spent and the only thing the four heroes can do is to start trading again. The first job should be quite simple: just deliver some nuclear material to a foreign planet. There is also some payment in advance. But unfortunately the crew takes too much time for the delivery and so the easy job becomes a deadly task and they become involved in a conspiracy.

This game is similar to its predecessor: The character creation, the trading (the main part of the game) and the exploration of the cities. But there are also some differences: Instead of visiting different planets the Whale is able to travel to various star systems now. All cities can be explored within a free 3D environment  and beside humans there are some alien races. 

The game contains different game parts: There is the merchant part with buying / selling of more or less goods, a strategic part in which the Whale defends itself against pirates or captured freighters of other merchants and a RPG part. Like in other RPGs, the heroes earn experience points by killing enemies or solving quests. 

This being the second game in the series, events from the first game are referred to and some characters reappear. For example, a woman which will give the heroes a quest appeared in the first game, where she was still a little girl.

The Warp Factor is a distant cousin of SSI"s Apple II classic Cosmic Balance .Best described as individual ship-to-ship battle in space, with simple yet addictive gameplay. Warp Factor is basically a crude adaptation of the Star Fleet Battles miniature rules. With lack of official Star Trek license, the names were slightly changed and released any way. This game is mainly about starship tactical combat, making it a distant ancestor of Interplay"s Star Fleet Command years later.  Aside from many commands such as ship formations, etc., the game was also among the first that let you design your own ships. Definitely an early starship command classic that would influence generations of successors. [thanks to Kuo-Sheng for the information]

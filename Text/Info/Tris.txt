Tris is a two player tetris clone. I won"t go into detail on how to play it, but the basic idea is to cancel out the lines by positioning the pieces in their correct positions. Player one"s keys are "W" up, "A" left, "S" down, and "D" right. Player two"s keys are simply the arrow keys. A player gets 5 points for every piece that appears. For every line a player cancels, they get 100 points. So, if you cancel out four lines in the one move you get 400 points. And that"s all. You can figure the rest out by yourself!

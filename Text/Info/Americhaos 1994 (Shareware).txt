"Bands of genetically-altered motorcycle bandits tough enough to shrug off shotgun blasts prowl ruined cities. Armored city-fortresses house the rich and powerful, while the rest face daily fights for survival.

The government collapsed two years ago. Chaos reigns. Outside the city fortresses, there is little order and less hope.

Tough times call for tough men and women. People brave enough to traverse deadly highways to deliver vital goods from one city fortress to the next. People brave enough to infiltrate bandit camps to learn where they will strike next. People brave enough to organize ravaged towns to fend off the next bandit assault.

People like you. Welcome to Anarchy. Do you have what it takes?

Americhaos 1994 is a complete hypertext role playing rule book. The game itself is not played on the computer. It is to be used as a hypertext set of rules for playing the game with friends."

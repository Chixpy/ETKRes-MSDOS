ROTAKTIX is a game of luck, strategy and concentration. Played on a game board that has nine vertical columns, or "wells". Each well is deep enough to hold 7 game play pieces, or "tokens", hence the game board will contain a maximum of 63 tokens. During play, tokens appear at the top of the game board in a row of 9. The tokens are rotated left or right using the arrow keys until they are in position for maximum scoring, and then dropped into play by pressing the spacebar. The amount of time you have to decide the best position, and then drop the tokens into play is determined by the level you are playing and shown as a "count down" timer on the info section of the game board. If this timer reaches zero before you have dropped the tokens, it will drop the tokens automatically, at their current position. One of the most dynamic and challenging aspects of ROTAKTIX is that all 9 tokens are dropped at the same time, sometimes blocking or covering up good scoring possibilities.

Scoring is based on matching the tokens, by color, in groups of 3, either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. These groupings are referred to as "runs". When a run is scored, those tokens are removed from the game board, and any remaining tokens, fall down to fill in where scored tokens have been removed. This falling and filling in can have the effect of creating even further runs to be scored, sort of a chain reaction.

Another game by the same team is Floatris.

Kakoong is based on the Korean cartoon series of the same name (also known as Kung Fu Jungle Boy). The story takes place on the Cloud Island, a magical realm populated by monsters well-versed in martial arts. The protagonist is a wild boy who protects the island from the schemes of Lord Kojak, who uses his evil super-power of noxious flatulence to subdue the population.

The game is a versus fighter that retains the wacky visuals, environments, and juvenile humor of the original. The versus mode allows the player to select a protagonist from a dozen of characters from the cartoon. Characters mostly fight using traditional punch-and-kick combos; repeatedly using the same move increases the character"s proficiency level in it.

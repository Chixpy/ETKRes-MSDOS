In the future, there is no violence. Instead, people play sports, one of which is Ball Blaster: a one-on-one soccer-like game played in hovercraft. Not exactly like soccer, since in Ball Blaster, the goals move, the arena is oddly shaped, and money earned by making goals can be used to buy weapons or powerups. These allow the player to more easily take the ball from the opponent, as well as protect himself from having the ball taken from him, or otherwise obstruct the opponent.

Extra money is earned by winning the matches more quickly, which can be accomplished by making goals from a greater distance--goals ordinarily score one point, but goals from a distance score two. Five points are required to win each match.

Lead the secret war on illegal drugs in South America! Wage war against drug barons with advanced weaponry such as F-22 fighters and AH-64 helicopters. Destroy their drug pipeline to starve them of cash, but don"t hit the civilians or you may get kicked out of the country! The drug lords won"t stand by though... And they had used the drug money for an effective arsenal, from missiles to fighters and more. Gather intelligence, decide on strike targets, and launch planes to accomplish their missions. Take over any plane in flight if you think they need help. Send in DEA agents to gather more intelligence and resupply local rebels. Can you win the war?

ATAC can be described as two games in one. On the strategic level, you need to figure out how the drug barons are forming their pipeline and the best way to destroy the pipeline while causing minimal damage to the civilian population, while defending your own base against intruders and attackers. You can order recon flights or gather intelligence from rebels and DEA agents on the ground. When you get enough intelligence, you can issue target orders to up to 4 crafts (F-22"s or AH-64"s). and they"ll go accomplish those missions if they can. 

Once you"re off in the air, the game becomes first-person simulator, where you fly through the jungles of South America chasing the target you need to destroy while fighting the drug baron"s mercenary forces. 

How you do in one will affect how you do in the other.

Plexu is a terrible PC conversion of an equally bad Amiga game.This real dog is the only game made by New Line before they went out of business - no surprise, given how awful it is. Everything about this game seems like it"s been pulled out of the "don"t" list of computer game design: pixellated graphics, boring level designs, clunky interface, and sluggish gameplay makes this one of the most boring platformers you will likely play. Stay away from this game, unless you feel compelled to play every Amiga-PC conversions ever made.

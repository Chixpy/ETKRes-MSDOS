Since I don"t know anything about tarot cards, it"s tough for me to say whether or not this is a good program ... however, it seems to be, given my limited knowledge. It"s basically a virtual tarot deck, where you can lay out the cards and tell your fortune. Unfortunately, the program doesn"t include a tutorial on how to read the cards. In any case, if you"re interested in this sort of thing, check it out. (Note: Setup can be tricky ... if you"re not comfortable using the DOS prompt, you may want to skip this one.)

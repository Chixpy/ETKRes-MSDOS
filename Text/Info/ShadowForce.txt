The year is 2110. After the great war, chaos and anarchy are in
control of Earth and its colonies. Cities are threatened by
terrorist attacks. Governments are run by organized crime.
Science has created new and terrible weapons. The end of
civilisation seems closer than ever before.

In an attempt to regain control over an almost hopeless situation
Earth Central Command, the heir of the United Nations, has
created a unique task force to protect the people and uphold the
law... the ShadowForce.

The ShadowForce is a team of four enhanced humanoids, each with
the strength and intelligence to overcome the deadliest of
situations. Now the ShadowForce is sent out on their first
assignment, and YOU have been given direct control over their
actions. YOU must guide them safely through the dangers that
await them, since they are mankind"s last hope for a brighter
future.

It is 2124, and alien life has been found in our own solar system. The location of this life is just as surprising as its existence; There is a whole ecosystem living within the incredibly hostile atmosphere of the gas giant, Jupiter.

When these findings became public, and the hostile nature of some of the creatures became known, the "eye" of Jupiter was declared a frontier zone. Of course, it wasn"t long before someone thought of a great way to make money out of our new neighbours and the first Hunters were dispatched from earth. Now TVs across the globe display nightly broadcasts of Hunters engaged in blood-thirsty combat with the inhabitants of Jupiter. Does no-one care that these new life-forms are being wiped out in the name of mass entertainment?

Well, I.C.E. care. The Interstellar Conservation Executive has sent you, its newest recruit, off to Jupiter to study and document all the lifeforms you can find. You make money not by killing them, but by filming their actions. You can then use this money to upgrade your ship"s engines and descend lower into Jupiter"s atmosphere, to discover even weirder creatures. You"ll also find people who want you to collect rare objects for them (also in exchange for cash), you"ll find strange alien artefacts that may or may not help you in your quest and you"ll probably have to engage in a few fights with the Hunters. It"s a little sick, but these images will be broadcast to the audiences back home, too, so you"ll make more money from that. Still, better to kill an evil Hunter from earth than a peaceful space whale from Jupiter, right?

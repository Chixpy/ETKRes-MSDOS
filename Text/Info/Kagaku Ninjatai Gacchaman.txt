The game is based on the anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (also known under differently translated titles Battle of the Planets  and G-Force). Set in the future, it describes the adventures of a team of five young superheroes under the command of Dr. Nambu, the head of the International Science Organization, whose goal is to fight evil aliens known as the Galactor. Led by the mysterious Berg Kattse and aided by a robotic construct known as the Turtle King, the Galactor are trying to steal uranium in order to create more machines and conquer the world. The Ninja Team is lead by Ken Washio and includes three other boys and one girl.

The game is mainly a Japanese-style adventure with simple turn-based battles with isometric perspective thrown in. There is no RPG system or character growth of any kind. All the battles are pre-set and dictated by the plot. There is no movement on the battle screen. Typically, the party of five heroes must fight several waves of enemies. The heroes have different parameters, but use the same techniques. Special attacks require Special Points (SP), which are gradually restored as the battle progresses. In the beginning of any battle, the player has to choose one of the characters and can only control him/her; it is possible to switch to another character only if the first one dies. There are also battles in vehicles, unique for each character; however, they follow the exact same pattern. Most of the game is spent repeatedly clicking on the characters" portraits in different order to advance the dialogue. There are some "Yes/No" decisions, but in many cases the game will only "agree" with whatever decision advances the plot. During a few segments, it is also possible to interact with the environment through a typical Japanese command menu ("Look", "Move", etc.).

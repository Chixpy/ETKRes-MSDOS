Hamsters is a charming Lemmings knock-off, with the player again in charge of issuing instructions to individual members of a stream of little rodents toward the goal of ushering them toward a level exit (through 83 levels in the registered version!) and their continued survival, all under a time limit.  Some of the 12 hamster activity types are highly reminiscent of those of Lemmings -- Sleepers, Jack-Hammerers and Burrowers Down are just renamed from the original -- while others, as in Shoujo Attack! have been assigned more whimsical abilities than in their predecessor, the Catapulter, Sticky Roller and Anti-Gravity Hamster among them.

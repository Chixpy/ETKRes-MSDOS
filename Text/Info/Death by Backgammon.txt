Precursors of this classic game Backgammon have been found to exist in several ancient civilizations, including those of the early Greeks and Romans. But the earliest version of the game is believed to have been created in 3000 B.C. by the Ur of Chaldes. (A land called Chaldea was a region of South Babylonia along the Persian Gulf.)

Perhaps you are already an old hand at this old game, or maybe you"re one of those who has always ondered "What"s this strange design on the back of my checkerboard?"Anyone familiar with Backgammon,however knows that it can challenge Checkers or even Chess in its ability to involve and interest players from all around the world. In this version of the game, the computer (mine is named Rosie) is your opponent--and a damn good one at that.

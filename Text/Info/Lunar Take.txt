The difficulty level will increase as the player clears levels. The player has 3 lives to complete the game.

There are high-scores table for the best players.

Version of the old game Rocket Lander . The game is a great rarity, and published only in Spanish, so - in Spanish (although the text in it is only on the first screen, but still read it will be helpful). player"s task at first glance quite simple - driving small spacecraft , to land on the moon. However, in reality it is not so simple, because the ship initially hampered meteors and acid clouds (of course, you are trying to say, but this is a game), and then - the mountains, which can crash, and, of course, the enemy - selenites, which is not very happy intruder. Plus, the amount of fuel the ship is limited, there is a landing desirable for a certain period of time, otherwise the ship simply collapses to the surface and break. The game has several levels, each of which game is harder. The player has three "lives." Graphics, unfortunately, is not impressive (and this is putting it mildly) - more than conventionally, pale and minimalist - but this does not in any way deprives the game its charm. That first of all it is interesting, of course, for collectors of rarities.

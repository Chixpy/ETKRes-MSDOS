In this solitaire card game, the player is presented with a pyramid of twenty-eight cards.  There is also a draw pile and a discard pile.  Cards may be discarded from the pyramid if they are completely uncovered and their face value is one point higher or lower than the card on the top of the discard pile.  If no cards can be discarded, the top card of the discard pile can be replaced with a fresh card from the draw pile.  The object is to discard all of the cards in the pyramid; if the draw pile runs out before this happens, the game ends in failure.  There are two difficulty levels -- in level one, all cards in the pyramid are face-up, but in level two, cards remain face-down until they are uncovered.  The game keeps track of ten high scores.

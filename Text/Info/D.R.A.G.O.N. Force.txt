An average squad-level tactical game, D.R.A.G.O.N.Force is Interstel"s attempt to apply the same level of complex and realism used in Starfleet games to small-arms tactics . The result is mixed: while the game is decidedly more realistic than other games of its type, its realism ultimately results in a tedious gameplay that"s a far cry from the quick decision-making and furious action games of this type requires. The bottom line: Play SEAL Team instead.

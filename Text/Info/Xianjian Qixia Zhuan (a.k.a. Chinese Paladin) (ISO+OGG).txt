Xianjian Qixia Zhuan is the first entry in the Chinese-made Legend of Sword and Fairy role-playing game series. The game is set in feudal China and features supernatural elements. Gameplay-wise, it is very close to Japanese RPGs. The player controls a party of heroes which he navigates through towns and maze-like dungeons, buying weapons and accessories and searching for treasure. Story progression is linear for the most part. There is no overworld in the game; however, some areas are seamlessly connected to each other and can be explored in a different order.

There are no random enemy encounters in the game: all enemies are visibly walking on the field and can sometimes be avoided. The turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. During the battles, the heroes can execute physical attacks, defend, use items, or execute special martial arts or spells unique to each character.

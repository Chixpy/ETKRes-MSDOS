The second volume in Sierra"s Hoyle series based on the authoritative guide to parlor games, Hoyle Volume 2 features 26 solitaire games, all complete with synopsis of rules.The games range from the popular (Klondike, Golf, Pyramid) to the obscure (Spiderette, Bristol, Nestor). 

The absence of famous Sierra game characters (not surprisingly, since this is a solitaire game) mutes the entertainment value of Hoyle Volume 2 somewhat. However, it still offers many options that card game beginners will appreciate, such as the "Easy" and "Hard" modes for each game, as well as Quick Replay option and the variety of decks and background colors to choose from. In terms of pure value for the money (and file size), though, QQP"s incredible Solitaire"s Journey is a far superior product in every respect, from the number of games to the range of options, including tournament mode. As such, Hoyle Volume 2 is recommended only to beginners who want an easy, user-friendly challenge. Those who are looking for the atmospheric fun of Hoyle Volume 1 will be sorely disappointed. Fortunately, Sierra"s characters will return in Hoyle Volume 3, which you can also download from this site :)

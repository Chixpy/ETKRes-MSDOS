This game is supposedly a version of the arcade classic "Xonix" ... however, you may know this game (as I do) by the name "Qix". Whatever it"s called, it"s a fun game. The object is to cut off as much of the gameboard as possible while not being caught by the flying orbs. The graphics are only average, and there isn"t much variety, but overall it"s fun to play.

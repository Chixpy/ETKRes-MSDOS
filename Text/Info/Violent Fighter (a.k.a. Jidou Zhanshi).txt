A very, very poorly done fighting game indeed.Besides having a cheap name, Violent Fighter has terribly small graphics, plain characters with simple attacks, and jumpy graphics. I was very upset to discover how poorly this game was made, especially since the majority of games I get from Taiwan are exceptional. I could not find a single thing I liked about this game except for its title screen, which looks semi-decent. I do not recommend this game at all, unless you"re a collector of rarities. It"s really not worth a try.

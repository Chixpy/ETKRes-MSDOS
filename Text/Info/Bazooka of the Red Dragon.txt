A fond, if somewhat limited, adaptation of fellow BBS door and namesake Legend of the Red Dragon, BORD ramps up the silliness still further while offering much of the same gameplay -- single-key menu-driven fantasy adventure and combat for RPG stat building toward an ultimate showdown supplanting the sinister Red Dragon and resulting in the deliverance of the village of Cotopaxi.

Slay monsters, challenge other characters to single combat, and upgrade your zany equipment (from Toothpick and Ball Cap to Elephant Tusk and Bulletproof Parka) ... and explore an overland map in a fashion unknown in LORD, building forts and encampments across the landscape.  Some of the jargon has been changed -- HitPoints become "owies", Gold becomes Pebbles... but the silly pseudo-medieval fun remains much the same.

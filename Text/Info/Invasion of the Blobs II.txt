Invasion of the Blobs II: The Evolution Revolution consists of 20 levels. Each one requires a different style of play to complete. Most of the time will be spent kicking blobs, but there are also several puzzles to solve and unusual environments to navigate, including underwater and zero gravity. As the title implies, the enemies keep changing and get tougher as you progress. The same is true for the game itself. - Mazeguy

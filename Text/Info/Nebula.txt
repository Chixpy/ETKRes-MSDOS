"For many years your solar system has lived in harmony, with each planet minding its own orbit, and not disturbing the others.

You thought that your life as a solar flare would be peaceful, and uneventful, until the summons came. You have to appear before the coalition of planets, and accept their charge.

The chamber was full when you arrived. Yannic, the little earth-like planet currently orbiting at 8:00, and Zenom, the large gas giant (orbiting outside of Yannic at 7:00) were quietly talking with Syin, your mother star.

""I"m glad you arrived!"" Syin said warmly.
""Why was I sent for?"" you ask. 
""We are in grave danger. A haloed sun in the 1:30 direction is on the verge of supernova. If the star goes our entire system will be engulfed! I charge you to carry the green gem of energy and place it on a dias in the bowels of this sun. The green gem is located deep inside Zenom, but I suggest you visit Yannic first to prepare yourself. Will you accept the charge?""
""I will humbly obey,"" you say quietly. ""Good. Good Luck. You may go now to prepare for your journey."" "

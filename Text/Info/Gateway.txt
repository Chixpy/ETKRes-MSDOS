Gateway is a text (parser) game by Legend Entertainment Company, in which you will explore strange new worlds and locations in the proverbial boots of a prospector, an explorer sent to places in hopes of finding previously unseen artifacts and installations of an alien race, the Heechee, which seemingly vanished from the Galaxy without a trace.

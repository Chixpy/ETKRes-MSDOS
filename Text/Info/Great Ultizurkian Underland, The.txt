The Ultizurk games were/are a series of shareware games released in the 1990s. They have a very similar look and feel to some of the later Ultima games, and even the name of the series suggests more than just a casual connection thereto. They are DOS games, and as such may require DOSBox in order to work.

Each game comes in two parts; the first part of each can be obtained, played, and passed for free, while the second part must be purchased. Each part of each game, and each game in the series, builds off of the plot(s) of earlier instalments, meaning that the series should be bound together by something like a cohesive narrative.

It was thought that the Ultizurk games were lost to time until just recently, when Infinitron Dragon managed to unearth links to many of the series\u2019 shareware releases, and Dr. Dungeon subsequently went on to re-release the first two entries in the series in their entirety, for free, along with Underland, the first spin-off.

In total, six Ultizurk games were released, and a seventh \u2014 Ultizurk 4: Lord of the Cyclops was never completed. The reason there are so many entries compared to how few numbered entries exist in the series has to do with the fact that it would appear that Dr. Dungeon put together a few spinoff-type games, such as The Great Ultizurkian Underland\u2026which I would assume takes some inspiration from Ultima Underworld.

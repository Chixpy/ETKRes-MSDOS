Ski King is a downhill ski game. The player can choose between four means of transportation: skis, snowboard, tractor tier and little sledge. The player has to race as quickly as possible down the hill and at the same time avoid all of the trees on the hill. The game has 50 hills and for every 10 hills the player gets past they get an extra life. The hills are generated randomly so no race is the same.

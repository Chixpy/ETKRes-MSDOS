Alpha is an elementary program for very young children that may help them learn the alphabet and counting.  It is intended to be fun first and educational second.  Initially I just wanted a program that would respond in a simple and direct way to keystrokes so that my daughter could play on the keyboard and get some comprehensible feedback.  At the time my daughter was about 15 months old and could barely manage to press single keys at a time.

As she grew I added color and music and the routines built into function keys F1 through F10.  The counting key, F9, is the latest and at the moment quite beyond my daughter who is now about 20 months.  The program works best as a parent-child activity, where you can pronounce letters and help with counting, etc.  Please do not think of this program as a way of pressuring your child into learning at a very early age.  My daughter and I have great fun with the program and I consider it some of our most pleasurable time together.  If she learns at the same time that"s a benefit but not the main idea at all.
  
I expect that I will continue to add features to the program in an effort to hold onto my daughter"s attention span as she grows into a little girl. If you have any ideas I would be happy to hear of them.  You can contact me via the bulletin boards mentioned above.  Have fun!

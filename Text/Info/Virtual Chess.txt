Virtual Chess is a feature-rich computer chess simulation that especially prides itself on a 3D, rotating chess board and pieces, complete with limited lighting techniques. By default, the game shows you a flat 2D board with a 3D game board next to it. The 3D board can be dragged and rotated to any angle you please. Virtual Chess also features some full motion video in the for of an introduction and some cut scenes.

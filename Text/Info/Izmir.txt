Izmir is a sci-fi 3D chase-view shooter similar to Space Harrier. The player controls an armored mech who is deployed onto a hostile planet and has to destroy or avoid mechanized enemies and traps on his way. The mecha can freely fly or advance on the ground; even though most obstacles are situated there, it is necessary to descend from time to time to pick up ammunition. The protagonist can acquire different weapons throughout the game, including energy guns and bombs. Each stage ends with a boss battle.

Another outstanding edutainment title from The Learning Company, Time Riders in American History teaches history of the United States in such a captivating way that kids will not realize that they"re learning something :) Designed for kids ages 7 to 12, the game"s educational content is much more in-depth than the ever-popular Where in Carmen Sandiego? games, with many photos, interesting anecdotes, and colorful historical characters.As in most other games from TLC, mini-games are arcade-oriented integrated with historical facts, and are not too difficult. As always, on-line hints provide ample help for young historians should they get stuck. Overall, another great underdog that was sadly overlooked. Thumbs up!

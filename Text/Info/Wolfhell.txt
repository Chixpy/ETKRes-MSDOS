This is the first wolfmod Acord Games ever did about 15 years ago. It has since been updated a little. There are 10 good shareware levels. Most of the graphics and some sounds have been changed and feature Pacstein and Doomstein grahics. It all blends together quite well, has an option to run with Wolf GL.

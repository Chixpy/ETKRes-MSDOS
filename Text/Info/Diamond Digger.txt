While treasure hunting you discover a huge shaft leading deep underground. Bloody marks on the walls warn you of a greedy ghost that haunts the abandoned mine.

You can dig tunnels, but that takes longer than moving through the passageways. You have to collect the key before you can climb down the mine shaft to the next lower level. While collecting points you also must look out for the ghost, because one touch from him kills.

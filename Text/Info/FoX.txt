A nuclear reactor in Tokyo has exploded, causing nuclear smog to spread around the whole world. This is causing disease and death to many, but surprisingly the Japanese government is refusing to act. The US government is also being strangely secretive about the whole affair. As no one else is acting, a British Intelligence Agent knows who to call...

FoX!

FoX will have to traverse the Jungle, Alps and the city of Tokyo to get to the nuclear reactor, to shut down its core to save the world.

But why are the US and Japanese governments are acting so strangely?

And can he not only shut down the reactor to stop the outpouring of radiation, but also heal the world of the nuclear smog already emitted?

Wordtrix is a simple but mildly entertaining game intended to be an edutainment product to help kids learn words and increase their vocabulary. The game involves fitting falling parts of words into three possible choices at the bottom of the screen (only one of the choices makes a real word). One good thing about this game is that through the various game options it can be made suitable for a fairly wide age range, and the graphics are decent enough, including an option for pictures to go along with each word.

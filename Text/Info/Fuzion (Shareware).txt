"Fuzion challenges geniuses to fit together shapes in a variety of colorful puzzle games. Play with either the 12 familiar Pentominoes or 35 awesome new Hexominoes. There are thousands of known solutions, but finding even one is quite tough.

Fuzion brings the power of PC computers to this fascinating diversion which has intrigued puzzle enthusiasts for years.

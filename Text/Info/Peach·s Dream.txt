This is a good-looking VGA sidescrolling game with some adventure elements, as well. You"re play the hero on her quest to save her one true love. The gameplay works quite well, and the graphics and SB sound effects and music are all quite good. It was made by the creator of the way cool "Quest" games, although it bears no resemblance to those games.

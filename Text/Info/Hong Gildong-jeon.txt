Hong Gildong-jeon is a role-playing game based on the classic Korean novel Tale of Hong Gildong by Heo Gyun. The titular character is an illegitimate child rejected by his family, who eventually becomes a bandit to steal from the rich and give to the poor. The game is mostly based on the Japanese RPG template, with top-down exploration, random enemies, simple character growth system, and solo turn-based combat reminiscent of the first Dragon Warrior. Locations tend to be maze-like, and the game often requires the player to collect plot items and use them actively in the right place to trigger the next event.

One day Ariel, an ordinary schoolgirl, is left after the classes by her biology teacher. The teacher, a pervert, as every girl in the school seems to know, seduces Ariel. While he does it, he is transformed into the Overlord, a creature who seduces and tortures girls and young women. As Ariel reaches her climax a portal opens dragging her 900 years into the future. There she learns of Overlord"s time portals, through which he has set up a series of erotic torture dens for young girls across time and space.  Ariel now becomes an Ultra Vixen and she decides to use her Superclimax power to disrupt the continuum and seal Overlord"s temporal access. To do so Ariel will have to channel herself into the minds of sexually tortured victims and reach the climax. 

The game is divided into 3 levels: WWII Germany, present time Tokyo subway train and distant future. Each level is divided into several stages; the goal of each stage is to get Ariel"s sexual excitement to the maximum using various tools at hand. Using right tools will add some points to the score and move the story forward, while using tools that Ariel currently dislikes may deduct the points from the score and ultimately bring the game to Game Over. Most actions are done by selecting a tool and rapidly moving it back and forth for some time. The heroine and the tools are in 3D.

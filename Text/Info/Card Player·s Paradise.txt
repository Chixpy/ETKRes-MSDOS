One of QQP"s last efforts after its buyout by American Laser Games, Card Players Paradise  is a good collection of card games that are played in world class tournaments: Rummy 500, Pinochle, Bezique, and Casino.As in Solitaire"s Journey, you can either compete in world tournaments or in the more innovative "quest" mode-- in this case a hedge maze that you must navigate by winning various card games. The AI and player history is also up to par, as usual for QQP games.

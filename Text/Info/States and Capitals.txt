This simple quiz game, included in Big Blue Disk #20, is designed to help players remember United States capitals.  It contains five data sets, each containing ten states and capitals that must be matched up.  At the start of play, each state is matched with a random capital; by swapping the placement of pairs of capital names, the player must correctly match each state with its capital.

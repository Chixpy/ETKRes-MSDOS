Warpath is a shareware science fiction space strategy game of the 4X (xplore, xpand, xploit, xterminate) mold for up to four players.  It is played in real-time, and contains some real-time strategy/action elements.  Multiplayer mode is playable over LAN (IPX only) or serial/modem connection. It was written for Windows 3.1, but works well in any Windows environment.

Like Spaceward Ho!, it doesn"t take itself too seriously and has cutesy graphics.  Unlike most 4X games, though, it is a "beer-and-pretzels" game, designed with a short-but-adjustable time limit (the default is 30 minutes).

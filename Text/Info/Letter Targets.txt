Letter Targets is a freeware ASCII-style game with gameplay similar to Hangman and Wheel of Fortune. Every puzzle number has the same mechanic: you can either choose a puzzle by typing the number or you can just select play and you will get a random puzzle. The length of the word is shown in dots when you begin your puzzle, and you hit letters on your keyboard to guess and try to solve the word. After typing seven letters that are not in the word, it"s game over. The game does not have a high score screen or a difficulty setting.

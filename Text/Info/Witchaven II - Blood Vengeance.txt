Your countrymen are gone!  The great witch Cirae-Argoth has taken them to avenge the death of her sister. You have only yourself and your foolish meddling to blame. But you are not meant to die...yet! Alone in the land that you have fought so fiercely to protect, you must gather your strength and use your anger to fight for BLOOD VENGEANCE.

Eternam is a combination of 3rd-person graphic adventure gameplay with 1st-person 3D travel sections, interspersed with plenty of cartoon animations.

You are Don Jonz, a marshal in the United Forces of Orion. After plenty of courageous deeds and macho heroics, he really needs a break. Luckily, there is something in the mail... it seems he has just won a free trip to the galaxy"s best and most luxurious planet-sized fun park: Eternam!

After high-tailing it to his leisure-packed holiday destination and slipping into a strange "barbarian" costume, Don Jonz is a little dismayed to find that this was all one big trap, set up by his arch-nemesis, the accursed Mikhal Nuke. He is now stuck on Eternam, with its life-size reconstructions of past eras and meticulously crafted bio-beings and who knows what is going to happen? Luckily, there is one person on his side: Tracy, one of Eternam"s best computer technicians. In order to escape Mikhal Nuke"s clutches, she had to transform herself into electronic impulses and hide inside the computer system, but at least she will be there for you in digital form.

There is a whole network of islands to traverse, each with its own reconstructed time zone and sense of hospitality. There is a lot of ground to cover before Don Jonz can get to Mikhal Nuke. If he survives, Don Jonz will need another holiday after this...

The game helps young children to start visually identifying shapes and color matching, while Mickey talks and provides supportive feedback for the puzzles presented as magic. Minnie Mouse is his assistant between acts. Mickey"s magic show has three acts:

Act 1 - Mickey juggles shapes of various colors.Act 2 - Mickey builds scenes by making objects appear.Act 3 - Mickey pulls an animal out of his magic hat. The animal hides behind one of the objects in a scene and Mickey makes objects temporarily disappear to search for the animal.
The version has enhanced VGA graphics, voice, and music options. It also uses a keyboard overlay, assigning specific shapes to the keys, so that the player can press the appropriate key on the keyboard to match the shapes presented on-screen.

"This is a menu of three games to guess the proper sequence within the alotted number of guesses. The games are Color, Alphabet, and Jotto.

All of the games in this package have the same objective: to deduce a game-generated sequence in the least number of guesses possible. This is done by:

Entering a "Guess".
Examining the "Grade" given.
Making "Surmises" about what is true and not true.
Repeating this process until the solution is found.

When the solution is found, a "rating" is computed. This is based upon the difficulty of the game chosen and the number of guesses made. The higher the difficulty and the lower the guesses, the higher the rating."

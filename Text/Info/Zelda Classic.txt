Zelda Classic is a fan-made update of the 1986 fantasy action game The Legend of Zelda, in which the young Link must search the land of Hyrule to find the shards of the Triforce of wisdom so that he can rescue the eponymous princess from evil forces. In addition to an exact replica of the original game, Zelda Classic features the option of using the original or updated graphics. It also includes ZQuest, a level designer for players to create their own quests and import custom graphics.

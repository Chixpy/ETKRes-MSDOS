Susan is a text adventure created with the Adventure Game Toolkit. The aim of the game is for the player to score in bed with their girlfriend Susan. The character starts the game outside Susan"s house, virtually empty-handed of anything useful toward fulfilling several of Susan"s requests, all of which must be overcome before realistically entertaining any hope of getting her into bed. To find the objects of her eye, the player must visit several other locations beyond her house, such as the player"s house, the park, and the confusing nexus of a construction yard-cum-maze.

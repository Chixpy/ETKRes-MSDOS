Mazeball is a virtual "tilt maze" where the object is to roll a ball through a wooden maze by tilting the board, while avoiding holes in the board. It plays very well and looks good. Ball control using the mouse is quite natural. Unfortunately only six mazes are included. (The game is listed as "freeware" by the author, however in order to get the version with more maps and a map editor, you have to pay for it. Therefore I"ve listed it as Shareware.)

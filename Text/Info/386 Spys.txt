Our dreams have finally come true: Now before you play, of which there is no mention anywhere. Anywhere at all, on any of the web sites, none of the world"s database. Formally, it is not there. But in reality it is not. This cute arcade you play the role of a spy, but where they should be called - persecuted. The essence of the gameplay is as follows. View from above, the action takes place in a specific location (eg, river or city street). We manage by any means of transport (such as a boat or car), and armed with a revolver, but at the beginning of each level must be chosen for him ammunition. You must then immediately start moving forward (which, by the way, there"s probably just at breakneck speed!), While trying to shoot from the numerous enemies on similar submarines, turning to it in different directions (we can see our hero-man). Case seriously hampered by the fact that in each location there are lots of obstacles (eg, on the first level - the river - is bathed people stranded, piers, etc., on the second - different road bumps, some big guards and pedestrians): we can just crash into something and die, as the enemy transports can "squeeze" us to any obstacle and thus destroy. The game is very difficult, but it is extremely exciting. Graphically, the game is made \u200b\u200bfor its time, at least not bad, there is not only a moving animation revolver hero, but even the animation of his flying hair. In general, the game is, of course, is the first collection value (I even dare to say that in terms of rarity is probably the most valuable exhibit on our website), but fans of sophisticated arcades also definitely worth a look.

A fun puzzle with a small admixture of the strategy, in which we are going to a population of a living being through the jungle of biological evolution. So, first we entrust prototype animal whose elements are combined at random, and the output is usually something absurd like a mouse tiger claws or cloven-hoofed. The survival of this miracle depends on how well it will be in their bodies (there are several options to choose from each of them) and how it is adapted to the environmental conditions (types of natural areas are also a few). Starting population - one hundred individuals. We can do some work on their structure and select the climate zone in order to select the most favorable options, of which there are five: soil moisture, temperature, pressure, and the vegetation that will be ranked on a scale. Then skip the course and see how the population will change. During the time while playing the course, does not affect the population only if it is in the catastrophic situation. Then the game will offer you three ways out: mutate (change pieces small animals), migrate (changing terrain type) or not to change anything. The ultimate goal - to help "stage" to survive for 31 run and score the most number of individuals, then to go along with them in the table of records. Hardly this game can take a long time, but to get acquainted with one of the earliest works on similar topics - interesting experience. Also, the game is a rarity.

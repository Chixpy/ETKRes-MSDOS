Prowler is a colorful futuristic 3D flight-sim that is fun for a short while, but gets insanely difficult so fast you"d need a lot of Tylenol to finish it.Nothing in the game distinguishes it from hundreds of other shoot-em-ups, although the low price back then probably helped (it was part of Mastertronic"s budget games line). Play it only if you have already played every other shooter.

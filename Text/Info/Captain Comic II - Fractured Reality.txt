In this sequel to the original Captain Comic, you play a comic book-hero-like space ship captain who "beams down" to a strange planet to save its inhabitant. Your only weapon is your blaster, which can fire a varying number of shots depending on how many blastola colas you"ve collected. Other items you can find include the pickaxe, jet pack, magic wand and other little trinkets.

Alter Ego is a game which tries to simulate life itself. The player creates his own character with different personality statistics, either randomly assigned or by answering a few introduction questions. Then the player guides this character through the seven life phases, representing the time as newborn to old age.

The gameplay consists of a series of situations which require a decision to take. This is done by choosing one of multiple answer possibilities, sometimes accompanied with a mood. Then he gets presented with the outcome and goes on to the next situation - well, it is not that easy. Every decision has long-time consequences and influences the personality, health and which situations await further down the road. Some decisions may even result in an early death or instant game over.

Every life phase is represented by a life tree where the situations are lined up; the motive of the situation card shows the general theme of the situation. After reaching a certain age, additional life options can be undergone at any time. Here the player can change his lifestyle and manage his love and professional life.

The game exists in two variations which depict a male or female life.

You control Mike the Explorer as he makes his way through the treacherous Pyramids of Egypt. There are 100 cobra-filled chambers to live through, starting gas fires to burn the snakes as often as you can. Collect all the jewels in a chamber and you can exit and continue your thievery in another dangerous chamber.

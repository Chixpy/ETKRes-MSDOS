The Princess Lorri has been abducted by anonymous parties to some similarly unknown location.  Which throne is she heir to?  King Altheon, her father, has the answer to that question, and it is to him that your adventurer must go in order to take up the mission of her rescue and restore hope to the land.

The fantasy land in question, the royal realm of Lorrinitron, bears a lot in common with Lord British"s Britannia, and the layout and interface of this game must bear a more than coincidental similarity to those of early Ultima games.

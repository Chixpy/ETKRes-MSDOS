This is the fourth in the series of Romanstein games. Using the best of Mr. Choi"s Hotel Romanstein graphics blended in with other topnotch graphics, and combined with 22 great games, Romanstein is an exciting game with humor, sex appeal, and thrills combined. The lovely ladies are much more pleasant to look at than the usual military clad villains of many of today"s wargames. Again, the game features full-screen capacity and a fast-loading title screen. Trapped in a hostile land, you must fight your way to escape through level after level of exploration and battle.

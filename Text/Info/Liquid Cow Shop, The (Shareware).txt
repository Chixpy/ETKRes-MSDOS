"The birds commit what the humans don"t" was one of the cries that Professor Gregory Schulte screamed as he ran.  Boozed out totally, and sick of life, he ran all the way to the Grussity Cliffs.  He walks out to the edge and looks down...

"This is what I have to do" he chants, and closes his eyes.  Betrayed by his friends and loved ones, Gregory felt he had no choice.  He raises his arms as the wind blows through his hair.  He jumps...

Free falling hundreds of feet, he smiles.  He opens his eyes, ad see"s the angels watching him fall.

"His soul must be punished" they say.  Gregory hits the jagged rocks below and is transported to a place beyond human comprehension.  He is whisked away to ... The Liquid Cow Shop.

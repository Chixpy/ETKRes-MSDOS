Air Traffic Control is a game based upon Chicago"s Midway Airport. While based upon reality this does not profess to be a true simulation. The screen is divided into several specific areas. The large blue circle is a computer enhanced radar screen. The screen has a diameter of 120 miles. In the center is a runway alignment shaped like an x. This is not to scale and is used to position aircraft on approach. Surrounding the runways are four white dots which are the outer markers ten miles from the end of the runways. Finally, a gray circle represents the current range of visibility.

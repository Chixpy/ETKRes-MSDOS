"This game is based on the popular TV program Blockbusters, and is similar to the part in the game known as the Gold Run. Once you have selected a topic five hexagon shapes will appear on the screen and each will contain a clue which will be one to three letters in length.

At the same time a Card will open on the screen with the clue letters and a Hint as to what the answer should be. Beneath this clue Card is an Answer Card which you should fill in with what you believe to be the answer.

You will also see a time counting away the seconds, and the idea is to get all the answers correct as quickly as possible."

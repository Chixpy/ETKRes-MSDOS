DWJukebox (originally DOSCab and WinCab Jukebox) is an MP3 and OGG Vorbis player designed to simulate the operation of a mechanical jukebox.  Although it can be used simply on a DOS or Windows PC, it is meant to be used on a PC built into a cabinet, either a resurrected cabinet from a dead jukebox, a custom-built jukebox shell, or an arcade emulation cabinet such as a MAME cabinet.  It is designed to operate as a true jukebox, and not a media player, simulating either a classic singles-style jukebox or a more modern album-based CD jukebox. It is a complete jukebox construction set which can be completely re-skinned and controlled via keyboard, keyboard encoder, gamepad, mouse, or touchscreen.

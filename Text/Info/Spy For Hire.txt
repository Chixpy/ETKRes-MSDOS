This game consists of 14 levels. Most of you probably haven"t a clue what the gameplay is going to be like. Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid by Konami? This is a tribute to the old Nintendo series. You go around through the 14 levels trying to reach a flag, evading the guards throughout the time. You have 20.5 seconds to complete each level(Keep in mind that this release only contains training). The game is over once you are seen, and you will be met with an unsightly game over screen.

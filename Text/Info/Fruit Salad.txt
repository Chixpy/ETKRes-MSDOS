Fruit Salad is a freeware single-player game in the style of Puzzle Bobble. The player is presented with a canon that fires different coloured fruit at a stack of fruit at the top of the screen. When three or more pieces of fruit of the same colour are stacked together they explode giving bonus points. Each level is timed as the top of the stack descends and the game is over if the level has not been cleared before it reaches the bottom. The game has over fifty levels and twenty backgrounds. The game"s level editor was available to anyone sending the developers chocolate or "something funny".

You create a character and journey as a solo adventurer into the dungeons and depths of the volcano Yserbius.  You see the game from a first-person perspective as you journey through Yserbius.  The story slowly unfolds as your character advances in experience while exploring the volcano.

Shadow of Yserbius was the single-player, non-networked version of the popular graphical multi-user dungeon game on The Sierra Network.

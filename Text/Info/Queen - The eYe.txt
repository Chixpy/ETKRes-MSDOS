Queen: The eYe is a 3D action game with hand-to-hand combat and some puzzle-solving. The game has a somewhat unusual storyline and music by the rock group Queen. In the future, the world is ruled by an all-seeing machine called "The Eye" who has gotten rid of anything which will promote freedom-of-expression or creativity. You play Dubroc, who annoyed The Eye by re-discovering music, and are sentenced to death in "The Arena", a show broadcast to the world in which the contestant battles fighting champions called the Watchers... from there Dubroc goes on a quest to destroy The Eye.

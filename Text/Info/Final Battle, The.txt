A decent PC conversion of the Amiga hit game and sequel to Legend of The Sword, Final Battle features an interesting plot (you start the game as a prisoner of evil wizard Suzar, imprisoned alone in a dank dungeon), adventure-style interface (look, use, throw, etc.), and a good automap, although the parser is somewhat inferior to its predecessor and the plot less attractive.Although the graphics is grainy and the gameplay involves a lot of pixel-hunting, it"s still an enjoyable little RPG.

"Zart is a variation on the "pillbox" and "bombard" games of yore.

Zart requires two players for regular play, or just one player for practice. There is no computer-controlled player during practice.

Zart features real time "head-to-head" play. The controls are very simple yet will take even the most seasoned video game player a few minutes to get used to."

In 2007 the author made this game freeware (was previously shareware).

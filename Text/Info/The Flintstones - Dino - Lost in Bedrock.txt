The Flintstones: Dino: Lost in Bedrock is a platform game based on the famous animated show. Fred Flintstone"s pet dinosaur, Dino is, well, lost in the city of Bedrock. Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble try to find him. 

The game is divided into several levels. You walk as either Fred or Barney through Bedrock, and you must avoid enemies such as crocodiles or turtles; should they catch you, you lose a life. You can pick up rocks to throw at them. 

At the end of every level, you encounter a boss - always a big prehistoric creature. There is a time limit on every level, but you can get coconuts out of the trees for extra time. Sometimes, however, there are spiders instead of coconuts in the trees.

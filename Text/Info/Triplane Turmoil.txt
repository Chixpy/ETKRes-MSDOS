A Sopwith-style WWI action game, Triplane Turmoil allows to take the controls of a biplane or triplane, and fly for the English, German, Finnish, or Japanese air forces. Play against the computer or against other human opponents via a split-screen display. Do well and receive medals, ribbons, and promotions. Form alliances with other players or go it alone. Attack other planes in the air or drop bombs on enemy forces on the ground. Your objective is to destroy as much of the enemy as possible, and to defend your own forces. Originally, the game was shareware, but v1.02 of the game has now been released as freeware.

This sequel to the first Last Half of Darkness picks up where Part I ended. The protagonist wakes up in a strange room alone, near a dungeon. The girl whom he saved in the first chapter of the saga is nowhere to be found, and the hero soon discovers that she is going to be sacrificed to an ancient volcano deity. The player must stop this at all costs.

Last Half of Darkness II is an adventure game that uses the same engine as its predecessor. Maintaining the horror atmosphere, the game has the player interact with the environment by selecting verb commands and collecting items to solve puzzles and advance the story.

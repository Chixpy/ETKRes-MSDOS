Oh, oh... The Grungy Brothers, your local neighborhood anarchists, are at it again! This time they have planted time bombs all over the Fenton Building, a high-rise downtown office building. You are the bomb squad"s expert on this type of bomb, so it"s your job to defuse as many of them as possible without getting blown up yourself.

To make matters worse, the Grungy"s have messed around with the elevator controls. The elevators still work, but all the doors are locked into the open position. Unfortunately, every time you get off the elevator it is programmed to return to the lobby, so the open shaft is always a danger as you do your work. If you"re not careful, you might GET THE
SHAFT!

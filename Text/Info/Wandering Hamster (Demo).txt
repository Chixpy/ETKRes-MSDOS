An excellent RPG made with the Official Hamster Republic RPG Construction Engine. The gameplay is great and the story is well written and funny. The graphics are very good, but they range from good to excellent. The excellent graphics prevail, but there is room for improvement. Also, there is whole lot of cool cinematics in the game. Since this is a demo it contains roughly three hours of play time, but there is a lot of different content in the demo. You won"t be bored. The demo features nice background music, but no sound effects. Highly recommended!

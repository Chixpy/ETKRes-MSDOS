In the far future, a fanatical group of religious extremists known as the Mondites have begun a campaign of galactic conquest. Lead by the seriously whacked-out Prime Paragon, the Mondites believe in the evolution of man through machine by cybernetic implants. Unfortunately everyone they"ve applied their theory to so far has ended up either dead or insane. Until you came along.

You are a prisoner in a Mondite complex with no memory of your former life. Your body has been turned into a hideous cybernetic nightmare by the evil Dr. Mastaba. The Mondites have discovered a long dead alien civilization of unimaginable power. And to make matters worse one of the aliens was accidentally revived from its tomb and is now running rampant throughout the complex. 

Bioforge is an action-adventure game similar to Alone in the Dark, featuring polygonal characters over pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D combat.

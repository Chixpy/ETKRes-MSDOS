Occasional the first part of the Dutch series of the popular platformer in this country, but it is not known outside of the hero - the Red Cat. As in much more well-known of the second part, Cat confronts evil mice, which in this part of the stolen treasures of all cats, and now only the red cat can get them back. At this platformer gameplay with a side view: funny fat cat in the "helmet" of the pan armed with a rolling pin-sword-shield cap, walks on the likes of dungeons and castles, collect bonuses in the form of treasure, and at a certain point and kill hostile mice in different ways (for example, by throwing bombs, which, incidentally, did not immediately explode, and in which undermine himself), but not from the start that the subject of several other things. The game often have to jump, climb and descend stairs, avoid all kinds of deadly traps (first level - this is only the avoidance of pitfalls and research), and sometimes the use of logic as "mysteries" are also present in the game (as far get something as something open, and so on). Naturally, there is "life", and our hero himself, in most cases, too, is killed is not very fast. graphics in this game is very nice and kind of "soft", which will certainly lay out the game and the young audience - especially wonderful moment that while jumping helmet-pot on his head cat bounces. All in all - a very nice and fun platformer, but unfortunately, as we said above, unreleased outside the Netherlands, and therefore remained unknown in the rest of the world. PS: The game in Dutch, but, first, the text in the There is almost no second - the most important phrases are written in English and not in Dutch.

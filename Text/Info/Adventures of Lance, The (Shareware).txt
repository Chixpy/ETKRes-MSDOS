"Once upon a time Queen Jennifer ruled Kyrule, the land was rich, the people were happy. Queen Jennifer"s closest aid, Rupert, turned evil and stole the scepter that kept the prosperity flowing through the Kingdom. With the scepter gone, Kyrule fell into darkness, the Kingdom was decaying.

Queen Jennifer asked everyone throughout the Kingdom if there wasn"t a brave warrior among them. Lance stepped forward promising the Queen he would help. She told him that Rupert had hidden the scepter in one of the caves, which is guarded by an evil monster.

The Queen was so delighted that Lance was willing to help, she gave him a magic sword in hopes that it would help on his adventure to defeat the evil monster and return the scepter."

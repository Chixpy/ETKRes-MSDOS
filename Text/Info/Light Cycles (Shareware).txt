This game was inspired from the movie Tron, and plays just like that one scene from the movie. Currently, this game is two players, meaning that two humans are required to play against each other. What you try to do is live longer than your opponent by not crashing your light cycle into anything. Such obstacles will include your opponent"s cycle, walls, barriers, and the trail of both your and your opponent"s light cycles.

Based on the original Judge Dredd pinball machine, this computer version adds some new things to the game to increase the game"s appeal.

The game offers multiple graphics settings, the ability to remap keys, and two sound qualities.

In the game itself, you are faced with a partly video and partly standard pinball game with a large loop ramp near the top of the table.

There is one table in the game to play on and you get five balls per game with the possibility of gaining extra balls.

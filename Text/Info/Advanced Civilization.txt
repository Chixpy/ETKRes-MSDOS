Based on the board game with the same name this game places you as a nation in the Mediterranean to rise and become the supreme ruler. Spanning about 8000 years, it covers the development of ancient civilizations from the start of agriculture to the emergence of Rome as the dominant power. Although military strategies are possible it"s far from any wargame as the main goal is to gain an overall advancement involving cultural, economic, political and religious powers. The battles which emerge are normally the result of shortage of land rather than attempts to eliminate other nations. The player who effectively balances each aspect of the game will build the strongest civilization and win the game. In contrast to most other board games the results of combat and other calculations don"t involve chance - the only exception are event cards which may involve calamities like earthquakes or revolts.

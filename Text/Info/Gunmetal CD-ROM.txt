As the game begins, you are a proud new tank pilot for the Nataka Corporation"s Imperial Armored Cavalry. A Nataka installation is suddenly attacked by forces from Network 53, a branch of the Argus Industrial Corporation and a long-standing ally. No explanation is given and a full-scale war erupts. All lines of communication are severed and the highest management of the Argus Industrial companies disappear. Negotiation is impossible.

A fast, fluid first-person shooter with MechWarrior-style ability to equip your RPV to suit different missions instead of relying on weapons found on your path.

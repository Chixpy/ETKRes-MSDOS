The Original Mulan takes the famous Chinese poem "Ballad of Mulan" as a background for this freely imagined story.The game depicts some of her adventures in the army. She starts out with Commander Lo and finds more fellow combatant in the course of the game.

The gameplay itself consists of stages you have to fight through. Between them is some dialogue which pushes the meager story along. The fighting is turn-based. You"ll receive items from enemies like food, medicinal herbs or weapons. You"ll also level up with enough experience.

Basically it"s like a RPG only focused on fighting.

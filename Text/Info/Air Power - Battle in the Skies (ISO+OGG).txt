Air Power: Battle in the Skies is set in a fantasy world in which humanity lives on one big continent. This means there has never been naval warfare and all action concentrates on aircraft. Unfortunately the king dies without leaving a heir and four factions want to rise to power - of course this means war. At the beginning of the game the player chooses one faction and which aircraft he wants to use (basically a choice between light and heavy hunter).

This is an action-oriented flight simulation with strategy elements. The goal is to get the majority of the population behind the player so he can become king. This can be achieved by conquering their cities. On an overhead map the next target settlement is chosen. Now there are three options to chose from: diplomacy (to gather the trust peacefully), besiegement or attacking. Depending on the city"s importance the player has to solve several missions in optional order - the goals range from escort missions over liberating the area to destroying ground targets. Every conquered city produces reinforcements for the fleet. This is important because the fleet sets the prospect of success for diplomacy attempts and gets diminished when the player fails a mission. Another option is to attack another faction with the whole fleet - the defeated party gets eliminated.

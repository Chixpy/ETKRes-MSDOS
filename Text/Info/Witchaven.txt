A "first-person, medieval action adventure with role-playing elements," as the back of the box classifies it. Based on 3D Realms"  Build engine, Witchaven is a first-person fantasy slasher akin to Heretic or Doom. The plot is straightforward: Descending into a volcanic pit on the Island of Char, you must fight your way through goblins, demons and other sorts of fiends toward the mystical lair of Witchaven to defeat the witches who have cursed the land with a shroud of darkness. 

Unlike other first-person action games of its time, the game contains a rudimentary role-playing experience level system in which you accumulate experience from killing monsters and acquiring items, so as to become more powerful (you can rise to seventh level). Weapons include such items as knives, swords, bows, morning stars, battle axes and throwing axes, and halberds. Spells such as Scare, Night Vision, Fly, Fireball, and, of course, Nuke, are available via scrolls you find, although the more powerful spells require that you have attained a certain experience level (Nuke, which disintegrates your opponents, requires you to be level 5 to cast). Scattered around the levels are potions which grant you such boons as healing, invisibility and strength. Nevertheless, the resemblance to role-playing games ends there.

Witchaven is possibly the most gratuitously violent and gruesome commercial game of its time. And though it contains a setting that allows you to tone down the gore, even with this setting on it cannot be stressed how intensely offensive some may find this game. According to the LSAC rating, it also contains "Partial Nudity," though it is probably limited to the bare-butted goblins running around throughout the game and some female creatures that resemble ancient fertility cult statuettes and hurl their innards at you.

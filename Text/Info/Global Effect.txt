A neat and unique strategy game from the makers of excellent Supremacy, Global Effect puts a new spin on the "conquer-thy-neighbor" genre by focusing on the environmental impact of your decisions.For instance, let loose a nuke or two and observe the result on grasslands, or grow more trees and reap the benefit. It is also among the first real-time games that offer multiplayer support, although the confusing interface detracts a little from the fun.

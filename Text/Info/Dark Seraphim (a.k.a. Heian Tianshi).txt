God created paradise, where the angels lived, and the Earth, populated by humans. The humans were not content with their fate and rebelled against God. But as a result, demons invaded the Earth, led by Satan himself. The proud humans of the city Sodom started building the Tower of Babel (sic), trying to reach the skies. God sent a high-ranked seraph named Alucard to reason with humans. However, archangel Michael thought differently, figuring that the humans deserved no forgiveness. Meanwhile, the Satan has his own plans...

Dark Seraphim is an action RPG. The player navigates Alucard through top-down locations. When enemies attack, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. As Alucard, it is possible to move freely and to attack enemies simply by bumping into them. Running towards the edge of the screen would allow the hero to escape. During battles Alucard is often surrounded by a large amount of enemies; but friendly characters can join him and fight on his side. Gaining experience points from defeated foes, Alucard can level up and become stronger.

Probably the best Go game for beginners on the market, The Many Faces of Go is a great computer version of the popular Japanese board game that is simple to learn, yet hard to master.

The game is ideal for the beginning Go player since it provides an opponent who is always patient and willing to explain its moves, and a comprehensive tutorial. With its many playing levels, handicapping facility, and Joseki tutor, the program can also provide a challenge to the expert player, although not as much as Ishi"s earlier Go Simulator. Go problems and professional games are also included. Definitely a must have for Go beginners, although intermediate- and expert-level players should skip this version and play Ishi Press" Go Simulator instead.

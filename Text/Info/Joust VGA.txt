A colourful but resource-efficient unauthorised fan remake of an arcade classic, all of the salient elements remain from the absurd original: the bird-mounted knights jockeying for aerial superiority (literally: when two riders meet, the one in the lower position is dismounted), leaving eggs in their wake and avoiding additional threats from flying prehistoric reptiles and the red hand of an angry lava monster.

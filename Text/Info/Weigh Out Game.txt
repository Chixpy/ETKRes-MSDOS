"There are 12 pool balls and a balance scale in this logic game. One of the balls is either heavier or lighter than the rest. The object of the game is to determine which ball is different and if it is heavier or lighter in the least number of weighings.

This is not a guessing game. The answer is not important just the method of obtaining the answer. Each weight and the next step is kept and if you are logical the answer can be easily determined."

The Jetfighter series returns once again, albeit this time it is released by Mission Studios, a spin-off from Velocity, the original developers of this franchise.  While once again the battle is against a drug lord, it takes place over South America instead of the U.S. West Coast as in its prequels.  The campaign is structure similar to Strike Commander/Wing Commander, where the scripted missions are linked by a intricate story.  The player is a pilot aboard an aircraft carrier, and can move around various places about the ship between each mission.

Jetfighter III features terrain generated from satellite data, with geographically correct cities, roads, and airports.  Flyable jets include the F/A-18 and the naval F-22N.  

A later patch allowed for 3DFX support.

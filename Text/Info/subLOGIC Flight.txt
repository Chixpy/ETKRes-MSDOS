After the split-up with Microsoft, subLOGIC proceeded to create their own concept of what a simple flight simulator should be like.  Taking cues from both Microsoft Flight Simulator 3 and Flight Assignment: ATP, Flight offers both free flight and over 200 "flight assignments" for beginner pilot training.  

Five small aircraft are included: Cessna CitationJet, Beachcraft Bonanza, Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee, and Mooney 201. Scenery includes airports across the entire United States, including four metropolitan regions in detail, plus Montreal and Toronto, Canada.  Owners of subLOGIC"s Great Britain Scenery Collection can import it into Flight, but all other subLOGIC Scenery Disks are incompatible.  Maps of the metro regions and a navigation table are included in the game box.

Flight was originally released in 1994 as Flight Light, which included only the CitationJet and the four metropolitan regions (New York/Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Austin, and Los Angeles/San Diego).  The rest of the aircraft and scenery were later included in the 1995 release of Flight Light Plus, which became simply Flight in 1996 after subLOGIC was acquired by Sierra.  The game was succeeded by Pro Pilot, developed under Dynamix.

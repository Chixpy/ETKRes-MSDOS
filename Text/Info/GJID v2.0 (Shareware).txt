GJID is a fascinating puzzle game, which will keep you glued to the screen for quite some time. It combines intricate puzzles with straightforward gameplay in 14 challenging levels.

Getting to grips with the game should be easy. The objective is to clear levels from crates containing peace-threatening armaments. There are three types of crates, which only differ in visual appearance. A level consists of a maze through which you have to push the crates onto disposers, where they are vaporized. However, this will not always be easy. You cannot push crates around corners nor can you push more than one crate at a time, and you cannot pull them back. Although these three limitations alone provide lots of fun (and frustration), there is another element to the game, the "one-way passages". You can get onto these passages from only one direction, but move off them in any direction. It is possible to push crates over these passages, or leave crates standing on them. There is also an exit on each level (marked with an E), onto which you should move as soon as you have disposed of all crates in a level. Note that you can move and push crates over exits, and move over disposers.

The object of the game is to complete all 7 screen levels before you lose your 3 men. Each level consists of a maze of blocks. Within each level there are 10 special green ($) blocks, which you must pick up (all 10) before you can go on to the next stage. Your man is used to push the other blocks around so that you can reach the 10 special blocks. You must avoid the spy cameras and time limits and delay traps etc... they make it pretty hard to reach the highest level!

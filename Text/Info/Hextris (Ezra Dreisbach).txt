Hextris is an excellent Tetris clone that introduces hexagonal (beehive-shaped) blocks as the name suggests.The edges of the playing area are also hexagonal-shaped to fit the blocks. The game is more difficult as a result, since there are many more exposed edges that must fit with other tiles - five as opposed to three in a normal Tetris game. If you enjoy challenging Tetris clones, Hextris is definitely a must-play, even though this PC version is quite bare-bones with no pretty backgrounds or nice soundtrack. Recommended for die-hard fans - as well as anyone who likes difficult reflex-oriented puzzlers.

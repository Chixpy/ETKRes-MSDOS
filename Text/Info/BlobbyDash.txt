A simple clone which resembles Repton a bit, with a somewhat queer story. It is about Wendy, a mutant sized girl who keeps growing because of the radio-active ingredients which Ronald McDonald has put in all his food! You, as a very thin and skinny character, have got the task to take away all this food, so that Wendy will be forced to go on a diet and will finally become small enough to be captured! As a unique feature in comparison with other Boulderdash games, you have different tools such as a drill which you will come across on your path. Separately there comes a level editor with the game.

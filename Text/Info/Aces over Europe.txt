Sequel to Aces of the Pacific, Aces over Europe takes place in the Western Theater of Operations during WW2. Fly fighters and fighter-bombers for either England, Germany, or the United States, escorting heavy bombers, attacking ground troops, or just taking control of the skies over Europe. 

Aces over Europe features improved graphics over its predecessor, including smoother models and individual squadron markings on planes. Terrain graphics have also been slightly enhanced to aid in navigation. AOE features campaign modes for all three sides. Although not truly dynamic, the campaigns feature random missions based on your plane type and squadron, making each campaign different. 

Player controlled planes include American Lightnings, Thunderbolts, and Mustangs, British Spitfires, Tempests, and Typhoons, and German Bf-109"s, Fw-190"s, and Me-262"s.

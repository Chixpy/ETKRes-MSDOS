"In War in Heaven, you take on the role of a being that arose from the primordial chaos of the begining of time. When you become aware of your existance, you realize that you were created by the chaos to ease its eternal termoil. To do this, you must create other beings, who are not quite as powerful as yourself, but capable of turning the chaos into more orderly forms such as land, sea and air. These beings are known as Archangels. You are also aware that it is also possible to create sentient life forms that will add to your power by worshipping you. These beings are known as humans. If your power reaches a certain level, you will be able to shape the land by mere intention. You will be in effect, God! All is not as easy as it sounds. For there are other less powerful beings that arise from the chaos, who will hinder your efforts to calm the chaos. These beings are known as demons. Also, there lies sin in the hearts of some of the beings you created to help calm the chaos. Eventually, one or more of these beings may rebel against your will, or even turn the sentient life forms against you.

The object of the game is to attain a manna level of 30,000 before any rebellion reaches the point were this would be made impossible. To do this, you must create and give angels to your Archangels in such a manner as to allow them to create land, sea, and gardens full of sentient and worshipful beings (very similar to The Garden of Eden). You must also try to keep these Archangels happy so that they will be unlikely to join a rebellion, if and when it occurs."

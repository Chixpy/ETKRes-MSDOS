This game will test your problem solving abilities, as you try to solve 25 word puzzles.

Each puzzle has the letters for the word located somewhere on the 7 x 11 grid board. Each letter is contained in a block which when pushed by your man, (Alpha Man), will slide in that direction until it either hits the side of the grid board or another block.

The objective is to push all the letter blocks onto the corresponding letters that are located somewhere else on the game board.

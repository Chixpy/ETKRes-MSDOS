Tamper is a unique and innovative stock market game that combines elements of board game and traditional stock market simulation into an original and fun experience.

The game is quite straightforward: as a stock trader, your goal is to maximize your profit. You will spend most of the game watching stock price movements, new companies on the market, and existing companies being taken over. As the name implies, for the right price you can "tamper" with the stock price: manipulate the market, in other word. The kinds of tampering you can do are much more varied than in COSMI"s older Inside Trader, but the idea behind it is similar. The way board game elements are incorporated is that companies" location on the board (the physical location it occupies) determines whether it can expand or acquire adjacent firms. The amount of activity in the company"s stock (and hence, degree of profits you can make) is also represented visually on the board. 

I find Tamper a highly unique and fun game that should appeal to fans of Monopoly and stock market sims alike. It?s unconventional, but it?s very enjoyable especially when played against 3 other human players. Recommended!

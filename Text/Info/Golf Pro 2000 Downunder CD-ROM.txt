Softkey"s Golf Pro 2000 Downunder combines the familiar gameplay mechanics of the 3-click swing meter - similar to other golf sim titles of the era - with a powerful 3D engine that brings the uniquely Australian countryside to life. There are 5 game modes, 3 skill levels, and a unique feature that randomizes the flag placement for each round.

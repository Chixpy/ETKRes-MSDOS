Your mission is to make a beach landing on the map (beachheads only), then to move from the beach and capture the Main enemy HQ after securing the area (i.e. clearing the area [5h X 3v matrix] of all enemy units). As an alternative you may wish to try a totally airborne assault on the objective, in which case you could get a maximum of 25 Paratroop units, no reserves, and a maximum of 40 bombing missions. With the Air Mobile HQ, you can capture main HQ, then you must prevent recapture by eliminating all enemy units. The risk is that Paratroop units, although very mobile, tend to be over-matched in battle with ground forces.

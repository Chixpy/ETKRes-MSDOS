Although anyone may find it useful, this graphics program was designed especially for children.  With this software your child can draw lines, circles, boxes, text, or other figures we call macros.  You can create your own macros or choose one of the macros that is programmed or built into the software. 

The programmed macros can be drawn in one of four sizes -- small, medium, large, and extra large.  When the drawings are complete your child can color-in the drawings by painting them with a choice of 16 colors.

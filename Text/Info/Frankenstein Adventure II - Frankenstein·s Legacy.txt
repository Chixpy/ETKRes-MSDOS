As the last living descendant of the storied Frankenstein family, the player has been summoned to the old family estate.  In the creepy manor, the player is charged (through messages in envelopes) by no less than the great doctor Victor Frankenstein with a crucial task -- reanimating the monster (in the basement lab) who plunged the family name into infamy.

This will involve gathering critical components from around the lot, from electrodes (nothing less than golden ones will do!) to some fresh(ish) human organs.  Crack a safe, navigate a secret massage, thwart the depredations of a local wolfman, and then just as electricity arcs across the long-disused capacitors and the creature stirs once more, watch things go awry just at the greatest moment of Promethean triumph!

The MS-DOS version was distributed only as part of the author"s 1992 "Tales of Horror" shareware compilation along with Night of the Walking Dead and The Sea Phantom.

Based on the classic Columns game (which is itself a varient of Tetris), Vertrix has you matching up falling 1x3 blocks to form matching sets of 3 colors. It"s slightly different from Columns in that there are more ways to get matching lines (diagonals, boxes ...) and more colors. It looks nice, and has soundblaster sounds too. Couldn"t seem to get a screenshot, but it looks pretty nice. Get it if you"re a fan of Tetris games. (Who isn"t? ^_^)

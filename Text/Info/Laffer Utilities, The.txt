This zany program would probably have been named Laffer Dis-utilities if not for the negative effects on potential sales :) This is a collection of counter-productive programs featuring everyone"s favorite nerd Larry Laffer that contains quite a few semi-useful things such as fax covers.The programs themselves are a mixed bag, ranging from the funny (numerous gags and jokes), to the completely useless (lotto generator) and everything in between :)

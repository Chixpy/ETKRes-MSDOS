Total Pinball features the same slightly changed four tables as its predecessor Pinball Mania: Kick Off centres around soccer/football, Jail Break is set in a prison, Tarantula reflects Spidersoft"s name and logo as it features a rampant spider, and Jackpot is based around gambling.

The main difference is the optional presentation of the tables in an isometric 3D view. The second main feature is a recording function to save a played game on the hard drive. During the replay it is possible to watch the game in 3D even when it was played on the 2D tables. The movies can"t be watched separately from the game. 

The handling is the genre standard: Space for tilting, shift to use the paddles. The player can set the inclination of the tables, the amount of balls per game (3 to 5) and during multiball (up to 10). It is possible to play the game monochromatic.

This computer adaptation of Games Workshop"s board game brings a fictitious and violent sport to life. The Champions of Death, The Underworld Creepers and The Elfheim Eagles are among the tough sides contesting single matches or a full league.

In each match you give the orders and watch your players act them out. Hire free agent star players to improve your roster or replace your causalities.

This was the final update to Championship Manager 2, and it was fully debugged and had the AI tidied up in several areas. The team and player data was updated for the 97/98 season, meaning that Michael Owen has emerged at Liverpool and Emmanuel Petit has joined Arsenal, for example. Nine different leagues are included, and up to 3 of these can be played at once on 16 Megabyte machines. As a result of this, more teams and players are included in the game system than ever, making for a more realistic player-signing challenge. A full data editor is included for the first time.

In Perfect Assassin, you play an assassin who has lost his memory somehow and you have to make sure he gets it back.

The gameplay is from a third-person view, but the camera is always located at a set place on a map. You can walk anywhere on the map and the camera will follow your movement, but it will remain on the same spot, regardless of what you do.

The gameplay has some action in it, but mostly it is adventure-style solving of puzzles or talking to people.

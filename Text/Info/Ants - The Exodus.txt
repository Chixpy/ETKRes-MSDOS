Ants:The Exodus is a single player strategy game from MHSoft. You control a tactical ant whose mission it is to lead a party of princess ants through a maze of tunnels to the open air, where they can leave to set up their own colonies. Your task will not be an easy one. Each cave is full of traps and puzzles to test your skill, speed and intelligence. To make matters worse, the tunnels have been invaded by red ants, spiders and wasps; all desperate to get sink their fangs into a juicy princess.

There are a total of 25 levels, arranged in increasing difficulty. Once you"ve completed these you can create your own using the MapMaker utility. 

I am setting up a downloads section on the MHSoft web-site so you can publish your creations online as well as getting hold of new levels.

The Grape Vine is a fun educational and colorful Bible game. The objective of The Grape Vine is to reveal the hidden Bible phrases letter by letter. Very similar in play to Wheel Of Fortune and Hangman but now with a new twist! The Grape Vine is based entirely upon the Authorized Version of the Holy Bible 1611 (King James translation).

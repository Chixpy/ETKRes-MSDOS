MaxIt is a nicely coded DOS version of a fun two-player board game of the same name.This turn-based board game plays on an 8x8 grid as follows: each cell on the board contains a number which can be either positive or negative. Both players (you vs. the computer in this version) take turns moving a marker on the board to various numbers on the game board; these numbers are added to the cumulative score of the player who moved the marker that turn (negative numbers lower the score, of course). One player can only select a number from the same horizontal row that the marker is currently on, while the other player can only select a number from the same vertical column. Play continues in this fashion until there is no valid move available (due to an empty row or column). The player with higher score wins the game. 

This DOS version is a fun, no-frills implementation of the board game. While it doesn"t look like much graphically (not that this board game needs good graphics, mind you), it offers excellent AI. You can also play against a friend if you want. Like the board game original, MaxIt is a fun little game perfect for a few minutes of coffee break. Thumbs up!

Klondike, also known under a variety of local names such as Fascination and China-Man, is probably the best known solitaire card game (actually, many people are not aware of the fact that Klondike is just one of dozens of solitaire games, and use the name "Solitaire" to refer to it). There are several implementations of Klondike available for MS-DOS machines, but most of them have very crude graphics (when they do have graphics at all!) and cumbersome user interfaces. This prompted me to write a version that would take full advantage of high-resolution EGA graphics and was intuitive and easy to use. Several months and a few thousand lines of Turbo Pascal 4.0 source code later, Klondike 1.0 was released. User response was very enthusiastic, and several users made suggestions that were incorporated in later versions. This latest incarnation incorporates a few more enhancements, and is generally regarded by its users as the best solitaire card game available for the IBM PC and compatibles. I hope you"ll enjoy Klondike 3.1, and encourage the development of other high-quality shareware programs by sending the registration fee together with the enclosed registration form.

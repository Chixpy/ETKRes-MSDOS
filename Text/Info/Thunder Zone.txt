The concept behind this game came from an ancient classic PC game called SpaceWar. The idea behind the "over the modem" idea was originally thought of by Peter Cellik (Sphinx) sometime in 1990. Sphinx"s efforts to make a better SpaceWar culminated in a prototype game called WarSpace, which was never released. A similar type of game to WarSpace which was not an "over-the-modem" game was released by myself called HarshGame. HarshGame was definitely a first-generation game for me, but I think it made it as far as some CD-ROMs that are full of PD software, although I"m not sure.

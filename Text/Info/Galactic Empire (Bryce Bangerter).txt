Welcome to the game of galactic conquest. The object of this game, like most, is to win.. err conquer the galaxy by taking all the planets in all of the solar systems. To do this you must land colonization ships (battleships do nicely too) on the surface of a planet, drop off armies, and hope you outnumber the enemy. At the same time you must protect your colonization ships and planets with your fighters, space stations, and exploration ships. The game is divided into four sections: Messages, Production, Movement, and Battle.

Tesserae is a very hard puzzle/logic game.The game rules look fairly complicated at first, but once you got used to the game principle, it can get really addicting. You"ve got to basically clear a board by jumping one different colored and "branded" tile over another. But there are many rules and exemptions to make the game more challenging as you play. It"s a real brain-teaser. Various levels of difficulty and nine different mosaic boards should keep your brain occupied for a while. Overall, a great little puzzler for fans of boardgame-style puzzles.

Welcome to Giant Space Slug.  You are the slug.  You live in a limited universe surrounded by deadly radiation.  Your purpose in life is to eat the space ships that constantly invade your territory.

Your bite is poisonous, so you date not bite yourself.  You cannot enter the radiation or you will die.  You must constantly move and eat space ships or you will starve.  The more you eat, the larger you get.

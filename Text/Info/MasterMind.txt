This is a freeware adaptation of the classic code-breaking board game Mastermind, where the player has to guess a 4-peg color combination, given hints with black and white key pegs.

The game is available in English and Norwegian, apart from standard rules it allows for alternate setups: from 4 to 10 colors and whether they can be used more than once. The screen also displays an answer counter (number of attempts made), a clock measuring game time, and in-game help.

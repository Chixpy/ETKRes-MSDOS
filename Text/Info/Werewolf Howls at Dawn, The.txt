"The last thing you remembered was hitting a large mean dog-like creature over the head with your silver handled cane. Looking up you see a full moon. In the distance, you hear the church clock chime midnight.

Looking down, you see a wolf-tag. On it are the words:

Caution ... This animal has been inoculated with werewolf simplex II. If bitten, take wolvesbane immediately! (If not sooner!).

It is midnight."

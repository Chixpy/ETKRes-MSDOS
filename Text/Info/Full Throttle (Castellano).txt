You are Ben, leader of the Polecats, one of the toughest and meanest biker gangs on the road. You were just having a bit of good clean fun at the Kickstand bar when old man Corley, owner of Corley Motors, dropped by for a bit of reminiscing. Next thing you know, you wake up in a dumpster, someone tells you about an ambush (of your Polecats?) and you got mixed up in the greatest adventure of your lifetime... 

In Full Throttle, you direct a character around a 2-D screen and solve a few puzzles along the way. There are a few action sequences. The graphics are cartoon-style, similarly to  LucasArts" previous adventure games,  Day of the Tentacle and  Sam & Max Hit The Road. The game features a revamped interface: instead of choosing a command verb or an action icon and then interacting with an object, you can now simply point at it, and the available action icons will appear automatically.

The sequel to Pee & Gity Special (with the titular hero"s name deliberately spelled in a less unsavory fashion) continues the brawler gameplay of the predecessor. Like before, the protagonists work together facing waves of enemies and punching them until the last is eliminated and they can advance to the next screen. The game introduces an additional controllable character, an anthropomorphic bird.

A new feature compared to the previous games is a shop where characters can buy various power-ups with money collected during the brawls. Unlike its predecessors with their hand-drawn cartoony graphics, Py & Gity 2 utilize pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds.

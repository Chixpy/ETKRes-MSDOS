Farmer Dan and Farmer Stan own adjoining farms where they both raise dairy cows. Somewhere along the border between their farms a new breed of cow has developed, a bovine which the farmers have dubbed the "Cowboom." These animals" digestive systems produce so much methane that they explode upon impact with hard objects (such as the ground). The defense department has offered big bucks for the cows, but Farmer Dan and Farmer Stan both claim sole ownership. After exhausting all peaceful alternatives, the farmers have begun to wage war, using their homemade cowtapults to launch the explosive bovines at one another.

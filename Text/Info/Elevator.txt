The gameplay of Elevator is similar to that of Spy"s Demise. The goal is to reach the top of the screen while collecting all the pots of gold. You start at the bottom left walking right. When you reach the right side you move one row up. Then you have to walk all the way to the left and you will go up one row again etc. You have to avoid the elevators that constantly move up and down. As the levels go up, the elevators get faster and the game gets a whole lot harder.

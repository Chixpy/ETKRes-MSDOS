This game was a recurring feature on several of Softdisk"s disk subscriptions; each time it appeared on a particular platform, it contained different puzzles.  It"s a combination word game/sliding tile puzzle in which letters must be manipulated and rearranged within a constrained area in order to spell out words.  Several words can be worked on simultaneously, and the letters that appear in the last word of each set are determined by the positions of the letters in earlier words.

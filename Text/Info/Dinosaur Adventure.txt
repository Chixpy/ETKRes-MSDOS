Dinosaur Adventure was, at its time, a decent piece of edutainment. I remember spending a few hours with it as a kid, and by now it only has novelty value if anything. You get to see a few cinematic sequences of dinosaurs going head-to-head, and there are a few (simplified) encyclopedic entries to have fun with. The text is all dictated aloud, and each dinosaur has different media items to play with. Lots of sounds, so I was never bored going through it.

There are about 40 dinosaurs, and many articles about those that discovered them, and what their climates were purported to be like, and -- finally -- the theory of their demise.

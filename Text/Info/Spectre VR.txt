Spectre VR is a frag-fest that pays homage to the arcade classic Battlezone.

Spectre is a multiplayer 3D tank game that features a capture-the-flag mode, futuristic graphics, and an intuitive interface. 

Spectre VR updates the original Spectre two years later, with better graphics and more tank types to choose from.

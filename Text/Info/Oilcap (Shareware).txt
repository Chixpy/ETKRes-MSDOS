"Oilcap pits you against the clock as you try to contain the gushing oil by creating a series of passages to control its flow. Quick thinking and fast reflexes are essential in order to stay ahead of the onrushing oil. Strategy is required to correctly place the oddly shaped links in order to keep the oil flowing as long as possible. Oilcap is a four star game that is a challenge for all ages!

Also known as Oil Cap."

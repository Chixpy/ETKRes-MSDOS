After the excellent The Hobbit, Beam Software disappointed its fans with this subpar adventure that has almost incomprehensible puzzles, grammatical errors, and an overall drop in quality.It feels almost as if The Hobbit"s designers took a long vacation and left some amateur to finish this game. Good for some amusing moments and general Tolkienesque nostalgia, but don"t expect it to be half as good as its predecessor. It gets credit, however, for being one of the first computer games that allow you to play multiple characters, in this case Frodo, Sam, and Pippin.

This precursor of BioWare"s Neverwinter Nights was an online rpg that was running on AOL for most of the nineties.It uses the same engine as the popular goldbox AD&D games by SSI, and all the usual features are there. If you have played any of the other goldbox games, this one holds no surprises. 

While this offline version has all the areas and features of the online game, the unfortunate fact that one cannot save the character makes playing it somewhat pointless. There is some entertainment to be found from just exploring the game area and slaying some monsters, but in the end I can only recommend it for those who want to complete their collection of goldbox AD&D games.

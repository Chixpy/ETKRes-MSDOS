Block-Man 1 is a shareware logic puzzle for one player.

The story behind the game is that once upon a time King Triangulos ruled the kingdom of Bentangle. The king loved blocks, he"d played with them since he was a child and he loved them almost as much as he loved his daughter, the beautiful  Princess Pentaguin.The princess must marry someone worthy so the king had a series of rooms constructed such that extreme cleverness in moving and using blocks was necessary to escape from each. The suitor who could complete all these puzzles would be a fit match for his daughter.Block-man is a commoner in the land of Bentangle but he loved the princess nonetheless and vowed to win her hand in marriage.

The player controls Block-man. Block-Man is in a game-area bounded by red bricks and flaming torches, representing the room he"s in.Every room has an exit and from his starting position Block-Man must get to that exit. In his way are walls and pits that he must overcome. The only available resource are building bricks.The only commands available are move left / right. pick up/put down and climb (a maximum of one brick only). Using these commands the player must solve the puzzle and get Block-Man to the exit of each room.

The shareware game consists of ten levels. The full, registered, game has more levels, and for a further fee a constructor option that allows the player to create and play their own levels and those of other game owners is available.

"Solitile is a game of solitaire, played with ""tiles"". It derives from several similar games, such as ""Shanghai"", ""Gunshy"", and ""Mahjongg"", which are played with Mah-Jong tiles. Solitile plays the same game, but adds new starting layouts and the ability for the player to create new layouts and/or modify the layouts provided. It has, built-in, ""westernized"" pictures on the faces of the tiles, and can also use alternate tile-sets, and the program includes a tile editor so that the user may alter existing tile pictures or create entirely new sets. Solitile 3 can also read in and use tile sets created for use with Nels Anderson"s Mahjongg game (of which there are hundreds available)."

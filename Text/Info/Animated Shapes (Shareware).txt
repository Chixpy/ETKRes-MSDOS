"In Animated Shapes it will display a shape, and you then select what shape it is displaying. The game will then ask what color it is, and you do the same.

While you are doing this the shapes will drop down the screen and will slowly form an object. Once the object is complete a short animation will play (for my first run the game created a car, and then the door to the car opened and elephant came running out)."

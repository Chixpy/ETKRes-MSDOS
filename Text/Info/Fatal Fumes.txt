Fatal Fumes is an overhead racing game featuring 256-color parallax scrolling similar to James Pond 2: Codename: RoboCod at the speed of 70 fps. It is the first project of a small Finnish group which later improved the game after its first release. The full version for registered users contains 35 tracks, twelve vehicles, twelve opponents, a track editor and both a 2-player and a general multiplayer mode. There are no weapons in the game, the focus is entirely on racing.

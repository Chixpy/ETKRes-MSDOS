Casino Games is a very early casino game from IBM, coded entirely in BASIC.Albeit primitive graphics and gameplay (you can"t expect much more from a 1982 title ;)), the game offers decent options and underlying (mostly random) mechanics that somewhat convey the excitement of losing big money in a real casino. There are three games to choose from: blackjack, slots, and poker, each of which can also be run as a separate game since it"s coded in separate BASIC files (.bas extension). Worth a look as one of IBM"s earliest games, although not a keeper by any means.

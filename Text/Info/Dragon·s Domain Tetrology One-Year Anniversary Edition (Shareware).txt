Includes all 4 of the Dragons Domain tetralogy (Dragon"s Domain, Dragon"s Domain II: Restoration, Dragon"s Domain III: Death Rising, and Dragon"s Domain IV: Spellbinder"s Retreat). DragDom was inspired by the old Atari game called Adventure. If you"ve played that game, and would like a little nostalgia, you might want to give these a try. They were designed on a 286, but should run fine on current computers. Each sequel not only continued the story (a story that can only be understood by reading the documentation), but also improved on the graphics and interface. This package was distributed as the 1-year anniversary edition, and includes as a bonus a small Dragon card game called Drahkarin.

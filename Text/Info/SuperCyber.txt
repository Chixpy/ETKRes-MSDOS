Spanish arcade rather mysterious origins - according to rumors, it was made \u200b\u200bby some enthusiasts for competition, for the Spanish branch of the magazine \u00abPC-Gamer\u00bb. In any case, today the developer, the official publisher (if any), and details the history of its acquisition are unknown (although the direct authors known). itself plays any "revelation" is not: it is an ordinary arcade shooter with a view from the side, in which we have to operate with a funny kind of machine gun (like a buggy), destroying over five fairly broad levels of different enemies (and one of them will swim a typewriter). Graphically Supercyber looks very good: 256-color VGA-palette, gamma bright, clear drawing, the special effects are. The game in Spanish, but to understand the meaning of phrases in the menu is quite simply, but there is no text, the management also "Spanish" (and that"s with it may be some difficulties if you have not played in the Spanish arcade). All in all - not a bad game, which now, of course, is more interesting for its rarity and mysterious origins.

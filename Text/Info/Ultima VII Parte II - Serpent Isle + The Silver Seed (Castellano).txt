This game takes place 18 months after Ultima VII: The Black Gate. Batlin, the leader of the Fellowship has disappeared, as well as Iolo"s wife Gwenno. A map is found that points to the Serpent Isle where the Guardian is still planning to destroy Britannia. Lord British sends you, the Avatar, and your companions to this new land. Once there, you discover that a great imbalance is upon the isle and it is up to you to fix it. To do so, you must learn the philosophies of the original inhabitants of this land who worshipped giant serpents symbolizing the principles of Order, Chaos and Balance.

Serpent Isle uses virtually the same game engine as the first Ultima 7, with some slight modifications in inventory managment and NPC portraits. The story however, is more linear and also more extensive. In typical Ultima-style there"s lots of dialogue with NPCs next to the usual fighting, puzzles and magic.

The Silver Seed was an add-in disk for Ultima VII, Part Two: Serpent Isle. It added a new scenario with 5 quests, in which the player has to go back in time to find the silver seed which would heal the lands. In order to fit in with the original story line, these quests needed to be completed before finishing the original game.

The main appeal of the game was a few useful items such as a keyring for storing the many keys could be found and a few interface improvements such as new hotkeys.

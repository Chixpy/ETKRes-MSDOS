In the year 1179, on a small island off the coast of Wales, Baron Michel de Lustie interrupts the king"s game of ha"penny with his daughter, asking for her hand in marriage. The king is annoyed with the interruption and sends him off, but the baron kidnaps the princess and holds her for a 50-pence ransom.

The best knight in England is too busy on a vacation to rescue her, so he sends you, Lord Avalot d"Argent, instead. It"s up to you to go get the princess back, solving puzzles and meeting various characters on the way.

Lord Avalot is a humorous text-based adventure game. The gameplay is a lot like the old Sierra adventures (King"s Quest, Space Quest, etc.), where you move Lord Avalot around the environment and type in commands to do things. You"re given a mouse-driven menu to use, too.

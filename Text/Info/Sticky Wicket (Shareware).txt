"Sticky Wicket" is the ultimate cricket game for the P.C. It combines the art of captaincy with week to week action of playing. Your objective is to win the league and "Sticky" cup. Your predecessor has left, despondent with the teams poor run of recent results. By selecting the team, choosing field placings, who bowls the crucial overs, where everyone bats and even when a player must run you aim to return the team to its former glory. Your success at doing so will be compared to the greats e.g W.G Grace , M.Brearly in the hall of fame. Hence the term "Sticky Wicket" hence the situation you face where winning is the difference between glory and failure! The shareware version is limited to 1 LEAGUE season only.

This is an old game for two players sometimes also called Othello.

Both players try to turn around the highest amount of the other players stones by placing his stones so that the others are between his stones.... =)

I have included AI in this new version ... but somehow i made it too good .. i don"t win anymore.... (well sometimes i do)

BIPS is a puzzle game that is quite similar to the classic Cyberbox series of games. The object here is to collect all of the gems on each of the many levels by pushing blocks out of the way and avoiding other obstacles. Although the graphics are less than spectacular and there"s no sound effects to speak of, if you enjoy puzzle games you might enjoy this game. (Note: Read the readme.txt file for playing info; make sure both CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK are off while playing.)

Corewar exposes the innards of a simulated core, a computer battlezone, along with the programs, the soldiers, that reside and execute there. Most games of this sort allow a user to write programs that resemble assembly language.  A simplified version of an assembly language has been used in this implementation of Corewar.  Programs of a maximum line length of 128 can be made from a list of 15 commands.  These programs are then read by the Corewar shell and placed into the simulated computer memory.  There, they attempt to "live" longer than any of the other players.

As this is a computer game, the execution of a program, hereafter called an organism, can be witnessed by the programmer.  A total of 15 organisms can be loaded by Corewar.  The interactive environment easily allows one to add and subtract organisms, step through the exection one command at a time, pause, restart and to quit the game.

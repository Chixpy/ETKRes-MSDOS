Crystal Pixels is a 3D "simulation" from the mid 1990"s, created by Alessandro Ghignola, who has gone on to create such works as Noctis, which is a detailed fictional space simulation project.  The game was originally written in Italian, and has recently been converted to English.  It utilizes blue wireframe graphics at 320x200 resolution.

Crystal Pixels does not directly fit into any genres.  Rooms and platforms sit in a void of space, encircling a lone star.  These small rooms, called "pixels", can either have objects in them, or be entirely empty.  When an explorer lands on one, they can move objects around, and can add and remove objects as well.  This program does not have a preformed plot or goal to it, but instead allows the user to do with it what they like.

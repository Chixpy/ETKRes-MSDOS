Schmootris is a weird Dr.Mario-style Tetris type of game. The object is to match the colors of the falling 2-part bricks. There are also falling politician heads (?) which can only be cleared by using special items. To move on to the next level, you have to match up ten pairs of ketchup bottles. I told you it"s strange ... anyways, passable yet amaturish graphics detract a bit from the game, but overall its decent fun to play.

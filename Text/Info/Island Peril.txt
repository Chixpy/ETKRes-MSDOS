A "2.5D" DOOM-era shooter with FMV sequences, set on Lorgina Island. Your girlfriend "Sweet Cheeks" has been kidnapped, and you must save her from the stronghold of the "Evil Boss" and his dastardly henchmen, (who seem to come back from the dead quite often...) with only your trusty raincoat and pistol to protect you.

Follow-up to John Madden Football, JMF II improves upon the classic with decent VGA graphics, ADLIB music, and overall much nicer presentation. Still, a decent-sized playbook, competent AI, and fluid controls make this worth a look for all fans of American football. And true to the game"s pedigree, John Madden himself provides witty commentary throughout the games. The console version of the game was somehow much more famous than this PC version.

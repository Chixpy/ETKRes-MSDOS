Yet another pair of Amiga cult classics that did poorly on the PC, Rings of Medusa casts you as a prince of the kingdom who must amass armies and find ancient rings to defeat the Medusa that took over the kingdom.Each game is a curious mix of strategy (build armies via trade income) and RPG (find the rings) that"s not too taxing in both but provide solid fun nonetheless.

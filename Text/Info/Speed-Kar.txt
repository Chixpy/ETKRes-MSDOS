"Speed-Kar is a tribute old simple action games of the 1980s and features a scrolling maze where you must play a variant of ""Capture The Flag"" by maneuvering your car around the maze to capture the flags (wow!) and avoid being run over (""tagged"") by the enemy cars.

Additional hazards include stones and other obstacles that may destroy your car if you bump into them.

As you drive your car uses fuel at a constant rate. When you run out of fuel your car coasts down to a much slower speed and avoiding the enemy cars becomes nearly impossible. Nearly...

If the following enemy cars get too close you can spend a little bit of your fuel to emit a puff of smoke and hopefully buy yourself some time while they are confused.

Each successive level features more enemy cars, different flags, different rocks, and different levels of speed, both for your car and the enemy cars.

Every so often you will have a ""CHALLENGE"" stage, wherein the enemy cars will remain still until either you gather up all the bonus flags or else your fuel runs low. If you die during a Challenge stage you will be advanced to the next Regular stage immediately, if you have any remaining cars."

In 2007 the author made this game freeware (was previously shareware).

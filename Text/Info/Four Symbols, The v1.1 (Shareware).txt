THE FOUR SYMBOLS was first written for the Amiga in 1992.

This was my first attempt at writing an adventure and at the Adventurers Conference 92 was voted best 16bit text adventure of the year.
 
It has since been converted for the Spectrum (by Larry Horsfield of FSF Adventures).  
An Amstrad version is also being produced, courtesy of Phil Reynolds and The Adventure Workshop.

This version of the adventure for the PC and the ST has been enhanced with more messages and a larger vocabulary.  Although most of the original puzzles have been left untouched I have made a couple of small additions towards the end, which are not in the other versions.

This version of THE FOUR SYMBOLS was written using TADS.

The Text Development System.

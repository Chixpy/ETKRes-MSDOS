"It is long ago in the magic land of Cornwall, where the Village of Lostwithiel nestles in the shadow of Bald Mountain.

There is an evil curse upon the land. Each month, at the full of the moon, a young man disappears from the village, never to return. He has been bewitched by Nirvana the Ice Maiden. She lures him to her marble palace atop Bald Mountain, where he faces a fate worse than death.

Nirvana can only be destroyed by ringing a crystal bell. Your quest is to find the bell, ring it in her presence and so dispel the evil curse."

While on a trip to Egypt you have decided to take a tour of The Tombs of the Ancient Pharaohs.  You seem to have wandered off from the rest of the group and now you are slightly lost.  There is no one here to ask for diresctions except a lizard or two.  You"ll have to find you own way back to the city.

You find a trail winding uphill and decide to follow it.  Maybe it will lead you to the camp of some desert people and you can borrow a camel for the ride back to the city.  This is a steep hill.  You stop to catch your breath and notice something shining just off the path.  You step off of the path and pick up the shiny object to examine it.  It looks like a Scarab Ring and seems quit old.  It must have belonged to one of the Ancient Pharaohs.  You rub it to remove the dust and accumulated crud.

SUDDENLY THE GROUND SHAKES AND TREMBLES!!! OH NO, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW?!

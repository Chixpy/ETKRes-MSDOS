Dodgem is a simple 3D-ish game which may have been influenced by games like 3D Worldrunner or Space Harrier, though it plays like an old Atari, Colecovison or Intellivision game. In Dodgem you control a tiny white space ship, which flies continually forward, collecting "Orindum" (yellow boxes) while avoiding red and cyan colored walls. And that"s about it. There are a few options you can set, and multiple control methods, but although it"s a neat toy it won"t hold your attention for very long.

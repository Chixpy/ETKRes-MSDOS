Like its predecessors in the  series, IF 3 contains three scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played directly from the main menu:

 The first episode, sub-titled Will for Suicide, is indeed about that: a person who tries to commit suicide. The scenario can be played in two different ways, from the point of view of either a male or female protagonist. reasons and circumstances of the suicide can also be chosen by the player. The scenario involves supernatural forces that change the fate of the heroes; however, the specific narrative is defined by the player.

 This episode is called Like a Magic Woman; the heroine is a beautiful young woman, contemplating about her future career and desire for money; at that moment, she is hit by a truck. Miraculously, she survives the accident, and is granted the magic ability of shape-shifting.

 The final episode is entitled Eday & Magy (sic), which are the misspelled names "Eddie" and "Maggie". The setting is a fictional city in the USA called "Autumn City"; it is being governed by the powerful Chief Anderson, enjoying an era of stability and peace. But a criminal organization targets Eddie, a young half-Japanese police officer, and he receives the assignment to bring the villains to justice.

The gameplay is visual novel-style; while the second and the third episodes feature few choices and the story develops more linearly (though some choices do influence the narrative as well), the first episode is more open-ended, also containing several premature endings that should be avoided.

"The Outer Limits is a game based on the B&W T.V. series from the early 60"s. This game uses parts from two episodes: ""The Cry of Silence"" and the ""Zanti Misfits"".

You play the role of the girl that is now left alone in the canyon. The strange weeds seem to be aware of your presence. Overhead there is a
flying saucer that appears to ""come and go"" for some as yet unknown reason.

Can you get out of the canyon alive? Look for the arrows that ""pop up"" every now and then. GOOD LUCK!"

You have crashed your spaceship on a strange alien world and must collect diamonds on ten levels to power it up and get home. This platform/puzzle game is very difficult and, at times, frustrating, as the slightest mistake can (and will) take you right back to the beginning. In fact, it claims to be "Probably one of the hardest games ever invented". It was one of very few in its genre to use text mode "graphics" which enabled it to be displayed in 16 colours even on CGA displays.

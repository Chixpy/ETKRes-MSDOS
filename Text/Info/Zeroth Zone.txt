Space action game based off the horizontal scrolling arcade classic, \u2018Scramble\u2019. DOS, suitable all versions of Windows including XP.

Zeroth Zone is a horizontal scrolling arcade game based off the classic "Scramble" game.

Different to Scramble in quite a few ways (don"t blow up fuel dumps but touch them with your ship to get extra fuel), Zeroth Zone is a fun shoot-em-up space adventure where you move through six levels of action.

We found the graphics and animation "typically DOS" but the game was still very enjoyable and quite addictive.

We enjoyed our time with Zeroth Zone and know that you would too.

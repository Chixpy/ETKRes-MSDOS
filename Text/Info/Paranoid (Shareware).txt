Although at first glance an ordinary Breakout clone, Paranoid stands out for its extremely well defined, solid gameplay, evident by the fact that once you get the hang of the seemingly difficult it, your achievements increase noticeably.Add neat hi-res EGA graphics, 30 well-designed levels and clear, annoying PC-speaker sounds - all in 61 kilobytes - and you"ve got my personal favourite of the genre. Registration for this 1993 shareware gem is still available, granting you 30 more levels and the level editor.

Forgotten and recently re-found a puzzle, the story of which the PC is very interesting. It is in our own platform game has been created, then a period of only two weeks ported to PC Amiga; version history have been preserved, but the PC version until recently were considered lost, whereas, in contrast to the Amiga-version contained in itself, and music (though the music was added later in the Amiga-version). describe this game is difficult. It is a rare example of an "instantaneous puzzle", intended for the "shaking of the brain." Each level is a set of consecutive screens (after passing all of them issued a password, the next time you can start the game already with a new set of them). The playing field of the screen consists of empty cells, still gray blocks and with various pictures (one or several types). These last blocks need to move within the screen, so that they come into contact with each other and disappeared. At first glance - fun for young children. But in reality - no. First, the passage of the screen gives the average thirty seconds (sometimes minutes, sometimes - even ten seconds), second - just a few blocks screens becomes several types, the third - to a point fixed block begins to interfere with the movement of you colored blocks, and the timer is ticking inexorably because ... All levels (no screens, namely levels - a set of screens) in the game for more than five hundred. And some of them you will have only a few seconds in order to plan your move blocks, and a few more to implement his plan. graphics in the puzzles is not assessed, and it is really hard to praise or criticize. About the same game, you can only say that this is just great and really trivial entertainment, perfectly crisp after a hard day"s work. And the fact that it is one of the most rare DOS-games, only increases the pleasure of studying it.

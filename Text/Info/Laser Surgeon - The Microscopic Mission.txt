In this difficult game that could make you go blind, you"re shrunk to the size of a cell and injected into a patient"s body (hrm...where have we heard that before?) to perform surgeries on different body parts. The not-so-intuitive controls takes some getting used to (using joystick is much better), and the graphics (low-res EGA) is really hard to see. Still, it turns a (cliche?) concept into hours of gameplay. Not as good as the classic Life & Death games, but isn"t bad.

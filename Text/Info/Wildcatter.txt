In this game, you own an independent oil and gas drilling company. First you must select a drilling site from the map of Boom County. After you enter your site, you will be shown a geology report indicating the potential pay zone. The deeper you drill a well, the less chance you have of finding oil or gas, but the chance of finding huge strikes increases. Shallow wells are more likely to produce. If after drilling to the potential pay zone and no oil or gas is indicated, you may choose to drill to ONE other depth at that site. If you do show oil or gas, you must FRACTURE a well before production. We have loaned you $1,000,000 to begin exploration. That is your credit limit. When you have completed ten wells or run out of operating capital, you will be given a final statement of operations. GOOD LUCK

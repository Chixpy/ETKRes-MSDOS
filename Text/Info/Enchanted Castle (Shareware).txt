Your adventure begins at midnight in the center of a medieval castle.  You have no possessions and you know nothing about the castle itself.  The goal of this game is to escape from the castle.  But beware!  The Enchanted Castle is full of traps and dangers!  Escape will require observation, persistence, and wits.

Although your primary task is to escape, to complete the game you must accomplish three other goals as well: you must bring out the priceless Star Diamond, you must find a lovely princess and bring her to safety, and you must destroy the castle as you escape.  There is no point score in Enchanted Castle.

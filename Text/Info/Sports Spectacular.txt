Sports Spectacular is a very lackluster compilation of 3 sports games - yet another "rip off" maneuver from Keypunch: combining public domain games and selling them without the author"s knowledge, let alone royalty fee.The games included are a golf game, an archery game, and a surprisingly playable football game. The golf and football games are represented by ASCII characters, while the archery game offers primitive CGA graphics. The games" low production value makes their public domain roots quite obvious, and they are not even fun freeware games to begin with. It"s a bit ironic to see that a gaming publisher who wants to cheat can"t even cheat with good games ;) Stay away from this one, folks.

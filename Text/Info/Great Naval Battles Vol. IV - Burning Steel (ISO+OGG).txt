A naval surface warfare wargame set in the European Theather of WW2. You can play in a series of independent scenarios or quick skirmishes, with the main bulk of the missions consisting of "alternate" rather than historically accurate missions (though you still get those) in which you even get to command the Russian navy. Uses SVGA graphics and includes a scenario editor that allows you to deploy up to 50 ships per side.

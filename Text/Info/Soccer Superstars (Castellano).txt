"Soccer Superstars" is a 2D side-scrolled football game in which you can chose from 32 international teams to take part in either friendly games or cup tournaments. They can be played against the computer or against both computer and a friend, but there is also a "demo mode" in which you will be able to see an entire tournament -or a friendly match- being just an spectator. You are also free to modify team line-ups (all composed by real national player names), select basic formation systems, game length, etc. Also, the game interface is multi-language.

Fallen Heroes is a shareware turn-based tactical strategy game in a fantasy setting. Taking command of one of the various races such as orcs, elves, goblins or undead, the player must challenge enemy forces either in single battles or in the campaign mode. Each race has its own unique units and bonuses, and may also make alliances with powerful creatures like dragons, pegasi or gryphons to support their armies.

The game"s primary focus is on tactical combat, with no ability to harvest resources or build settlements during the battle. The player may choose a pre-set army or assemble a custom fighting force, and similarly there is the ability to create new maps with the built-in editor in addition to pre-generated maps and scenarios that come with the game. Each scenario can be further customized to increase or decrease difficulty by handicapping one of the combatants, limiting the units" line of sight, and adjusting other options like the time of day at which the battle takes place.

Fallen Heroes also supports multi-player mode either as hot seat or via modem/null modem. The game keeps track of each player"s performance during the battle and presents them in the form of charts. Post-battle statistics are similarly summarized in chart form, allowing the players to compare their scores.

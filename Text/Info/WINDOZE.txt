"Use the J, K, L and I keys to maneuver the falling icons. The idea is to get three or more of the same icons in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The spacebar drops them into place. The farther they fall, (you guessed it) the more the points.

Every 1000 points, ""???"" icons fall. These match anything they hit, and ALL matching icons are zapped. Zapping icons tends to cause interesting chain reactions that provide even more points. 

Some unscrupulous individuals have been known to cheat using the Pause key. Not that you would stoop to such a practice, but if your keyboard doesn"t have a Pause key, try Ctrl + Num Lock."

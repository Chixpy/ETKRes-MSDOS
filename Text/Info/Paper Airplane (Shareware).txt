"After several unsuccessful inventions, you finally discover something useful, a miniaturized radio control and remote TV camera system.

You had just completed your patent application papers for it when you received an anonymous call that informed you that a company called XEMTX had stolen your idea and was applying for a patent on it too. If Xemtx gets the patent to the patent office first, they"ll get your idea patented under their name and will get all the money from it.

Xemtx is located only 20 miles from the patent office, while you live over 900 miles from it. Floods have knocked out many nearby bridges, so getting to the patent office in your car would be impossible. There are no airports in or near the puny town that you live in. Your fax machine is broken. The mail would be too slow. In desperation, you make your patent application papers into a paper airplane and attach your radio control and remote TV camera system to it. After attaching a motor, propeller, and control surfaces, you"re ready to fly."

Atomic Tetris uses the same rules and principles as does the original version of Tetris. You know\u2026you drop pieces, try to complete lines, don"t let it pile up type of thing. I"m going to assume you already know how to play Tetris\u2026if you don"t, you might want to get ahold of VGATetris. It"s a simple version of Tetris which will explain to you how to play.

Atomic Tetris has a twist however. It"s a two player Tetris game were each player tries to destroy the other. A person wins the game by surviving longer than his/her opponent. That is, that your opponent piles up his/her screen before you do. Simple mistakes on your opponent"s part, or strategic moves on your part can win you the game.

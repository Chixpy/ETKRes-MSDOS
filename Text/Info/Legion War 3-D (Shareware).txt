The objective of the game is to capture all of the opposing player"s land and to destroy all of the opposing player"s legions. Capturing the opposing player"s home square is a key goal in achieving success. The opposing player"s home square is the square from which all of the opposing player"s legions are formed. The location of this square is not marked on the map however it"s location is obvious. Your home square is the location where all of your legions are formed and you should take care in protecting it from the opposing player"s forces. Once you capture the opposing player"s home square you are free to move your legion off of that square and the opposing player will not be able to form any more legions as long as that square remains in your color.

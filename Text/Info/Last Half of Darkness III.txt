The sequel to Last Half of Darkness Part II starts where Part II left off. The hero finds himself stranded alone on an island inhabited by living dead (which seem to not have vicious or violent intentions) and, again, has to find the girl he saved in the previous chapters of the saga.

The third installment of the series utilizes a different engine and interface. Instead of selecting concrete verb commands, the players interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion. Another difference is the introduction of a life bar for the player character, which reduces the amount of instant death moments, replacing them with damage taken by the protagonist. The exploration is also more open-ended than in the previous installments.

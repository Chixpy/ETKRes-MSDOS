Action-puzzle games are faily rare, but this one probably could qualify as both. The goal is to collect as much gold and silver as possible before the other players (other humans or computer controlled) and avoiding blowing yourself up or getting blown up by the other players. It"s a slickly produced game with crisp VGA graphics and a nice tutorial at the beginning to explain how to play.

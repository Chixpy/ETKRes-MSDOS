LobSter is a tribute to Worms, Scorched Earth, Over The Hill, and whatnot. I have loved these games since I first played Over The Hill on my Atari 800 in 1985.  Please enjoy my little imitation game here.  I plan someday to sink another week or two into this and add a lot more to it, but for a 1.0 freeware title, this seems pretty good right now.

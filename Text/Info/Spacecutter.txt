Review for this game can not write. It is remarkable in its sweet simplicity, but its meaning is placed in the same sentence. You control a small space ship and destroy alien flying saucers in a particular sector of space (which is - show in the briefing before the mission). There was no hint of the plot here. Graphically looks though "minimalist", but beautiful. It may be of interest to a very big fan of any letalok and collectors because of exceptional rarity and full of forgotten (try to find a game though any information ...).

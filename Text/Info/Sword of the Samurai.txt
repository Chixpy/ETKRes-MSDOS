Sword of the Samurai simulates feudal leadership in 15th century Japan. Players take on the role of a young samurai warrior with a small kingdom. You and your neighbors vie for land and perform feats to win the favour of your lord, struggling to win the shogunate. Time will be spent managing the kingdom and wandering through feudal Japan; setting the scene for arcade sequences that determine your standing. Win the battle, gain land; beat the swordsman, gain honour.

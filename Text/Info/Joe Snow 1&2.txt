Joe Snow is an EGA sidescrolling jumping game, the object of which is to get to the top of the screen. Along they way, you pick up items which add to your score, and obstacles which subtract from your score. As long as you collect enough items to keep your score above 0, you can continue in the level. It"s a neat idea that improves what would have been a mediocre game otherwise. The controls are a bit touchy but the game still is rather charming. (Games 1 & 2 of the series are included, both use the same engine, the only differences are the levels and the graphics used.)

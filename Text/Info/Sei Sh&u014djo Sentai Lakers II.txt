The sequel to Sei Sh\u014djo Sentai Lakers directly continues the story from the previous game. Akira and his team of school girls with supernatural powers have repelled Galvan"s forces and protected the Laker Crystals. However, a new adversary named Rayott appears on the stage. Obtaining his power from Leticia, the former commander of the Gadram Empire, Rayott intends to use the power of the crystals in order to invade Earth.

The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, consisting of turn-based tactical battles and lengthy cutscenes interspersed by occasional adventure-like interaction between them. Battle interface underwent some changes, and there are a few more customization options for the characters; otherwise, the combat system is identical to that of the previous game.

A Snakes duel game for two human players only. You and your opponent move around the screen while leaving a trace. The goal is to survive longer than the opponent. Worms die if they hit the wall or any piece of trace. Despite few interesting features in the gameplay, the poor graphics, poor choice of control keys and lack of the computer opponent make this game very unappealing.

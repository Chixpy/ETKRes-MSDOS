A Tetris clone with beautiful, partly 3D rendered graphics and some extras ("Mana"). It runs well under XP and DOSBox, but not so well under Windows 98.

This game requires PC compatible machine with a VGA-card (MCGA should work just fine ). You must have at least 460,000 bytes of free conventional memory ( 430,000 bytes if you have at least 250kB EMS memory ). Fintris was created using a 486/33, but it has been tested on several 386 and 286 machines and it worked just fine. Mouse is supported.

As the name suggests, this game is about colors, not shapes. Single blocks fall down, and rows (3+) of identical color vanish. At the first glance, the game seems dull, as there is no noticeable increase of difficulty. But quickly, it becomes pretty addictive.

Another game by Mike Wiering is Mario & Luigi.

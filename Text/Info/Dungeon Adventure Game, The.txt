Excellent maze game for ages 8 to 12; try it!

This is a fun maze game for ages 8 to 12.

Graphics are basic but the concept is excellent and the game is very playable.

There are quite a number of things to find, monsters to kill and secrets to uncover that most younger users will be enthralled. There is a good use of the "F" keys (unlike many DOS games) \u2013 even F11 and F12. These function keys are combined with other keys (Alt key, etc) to offer quite a range of tasks.

We would suggest printing out the documentation which comes with the game so you have the list handy.

The source code is offered with this public domain game so you might want to build your own version.

Overall we were quite impressed.

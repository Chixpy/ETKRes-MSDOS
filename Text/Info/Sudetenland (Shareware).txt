Sudetenland is a boardgame style, operational level, DOS computer game of a hypothetical German attack on Czechoslovakia in October, 1938 (no peace in our time). Units are the army divisions and divisional equivalents which were available for the planned German campaign. Though designed primarily for two-person or classic boardgame solitaire play, you may play either side against the computer. There is also a custom designed play by E-mail feature. User documentation consists of a 38 page instruction booklet, a map of the game board, plus separate installation and memory configuration instructions. Orders of battle are in an ASCII text file. There is no copy protection. Sudetenland is an easy-to-play, medium-complexity simulation.

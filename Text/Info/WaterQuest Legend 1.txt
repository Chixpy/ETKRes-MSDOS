...This is the story of Prince Ralum, a bold adventurer who set out to find the fabled LifeLake in an attempt to save his dying father, as told by several tavern patrons to two young strangers (run README.EXE). Before you begin, read the important information in README.TXT explaining how to easily slow down your Windows DOS session to emulate a 25Mhz 486 (slowdown.com is included and already called by the WQ1.BAT startup file), and how to obtain a copy of QBASIC.EXE from the Microsoft FTP site (presently part of "olddos" here). WaterQuest is a large, difficult, fun RPG/Quest/Adventure with several different levels, lots of items, small quests to complete, and strange monsters to kill or avoid. For such an outdated game, it"s still pretty cool!

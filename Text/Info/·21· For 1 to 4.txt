Big Blue Disk #31 is a monthly disk issued by Softdisk Publishing. This issue contained one game, "21" For 1 to 4, which is a blackjack game for one to four players. In this game the player starts with $100 and gambles it to make a fortune or loses it all, in which case they have to withdraw another $100 from their secret Swiss account to continue playing. There is no save game feature, no high score feature, and the game is completely keyboard controlled.

"GREYHOUND is a game in which you are the owner of a greyhound kennel. You must use your skill and judgment to compete against other kennels and ultimately win the Championship Trophy at the end of the season.

Each week there are 10 races. Each race is for a specific grade. The top grade is 1, the bottom is 10. Only grade 1 wins count towards the championship. Much of the time you must spend moving your dogs through the gradings. This is achieved by a combination of success in races and careful training."

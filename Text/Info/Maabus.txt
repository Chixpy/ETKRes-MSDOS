Bizarre radiation is discovered on a remote tropical island, and you are chosen to pilot an automated probe to discover the source of the radiation. As in most adventure games, you must find the clues and keys to solve the puzzle and (inevitably) prevent the destruction of Earth.

Maabus uses three CD"s worth of Quick-Time Video clips to generate scene transitions as you pilot an automated tank across the mysterious island.

NOTA: Pulsar CTRL+F4 para cambiar de CD cuando el juego lo pida.

Pacstein II carries Pacstein another notch upward, adding new features such as textured floors and ceilings, and full-screen capacities. Gary has added all the features he could find in studying 100 or so other Wolfmod games to make Pacstein a better game. Again 20 different maps are featured, and the graphics are very impressive in this full-screen mode.

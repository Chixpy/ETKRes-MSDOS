You"re An alien Spaceship and you use your Hyper Beam to collect and transport the items from earth to your ship.

There are 4 levels (It"s a really small game, I know!-heh) Each level has a time limit in which you have to collect all the chosen items(The computer randomly chooses one of the three items you have to collect).
If you fail to collect the chosen Items its Game over for you!!

Each time you play a level the items are randomly spread across the level, some items appearing more then others, the item you must collect is also randomly chosen.

So each time you play the game its a little different sometimes being harder and sometimes being easier.

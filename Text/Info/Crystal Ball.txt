Crystal Ball is a shareware program that makes predictions about the future! This game features two modes. In the first mode, you may select from a list of predefined questions to see what the crystal ball thinks will happen. Political elections, the future of science, and advances in health and education are among the topics that can be selected. The second variation lets you type in your own questions that you would like a prediction on. In either case, the crystal ball will spend a few moments thinking and then display its prediction. You may choose to save predictions to disk, or print them out. Also included is a vocabulary editor which allows you to edit all of the words available to the crystal ball.

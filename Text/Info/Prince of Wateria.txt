Prince of Wateria is a fan-made modification of Prince of Persia 1. 

Creating this modification, including all graphical changes and the related (trailer and walkthrough) videos, took about 220 hours of work during a period of 4.5 months. This modification features new graphics, a new story, dripping faucets, boarded-up windows, reshaped potions, secret passages, reshaped chompers (metal jaws), a laser field, deteriorating and passable closed gates, new challenging and tough levels, and so on. Have fun playing!

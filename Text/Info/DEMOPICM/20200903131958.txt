This program, ABC, is intended to teach the 
alphabet to the user. There are a series of exercises 
the user may go thru in order or via the menu may 
access any individual exercise.  Those exercises are 
listed below:

             Matching 'upper case' letters to 'upper case 
letters'
             Matching 'lower case' letters to 'lower case 
letters'

the word' (4 screens of 13 pictures)
        Concentration game with letter and word 
cards and picture cards (5 screens of 20 cards)

The only system requirement is a VGA monitor.  
However, if you copy all files to your hard disk the 
program runs much quicker and is generally more 
enjoyable.

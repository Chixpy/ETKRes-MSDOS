Corncob Deluxe takes place in an alternative history where World War II never happened. But all is not well. Instead of fighting Nazis, the world must deal with an even more deadly enemy...aliens.

You take control of the Corsair "Corncob" and fight off the invaders in this sci-fi air-combat simulation.

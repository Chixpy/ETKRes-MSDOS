It sure is tiny. It is less than 2.3.7kB in size, the smallest one of all the graphic Tetris games, and barely larger than Tore Bastiansen"s Small Tetris.

It will, however, not run on slower machines. At the very least it requires a 386, and it will run only on MS-DOS or Windows, not even on PC-DOS. It does run in DOSBox though. But it will run well on XP on newer computers.

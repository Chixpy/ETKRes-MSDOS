"In the first two levels, you must move the boy forward through the alien spaceship to reach the escape pod. On the way, aliens will pop out of the walls and ceiling trying to kill you so that they can dissect your body.

Once you get in the escape pod, you must dodge the asteroids by flying to the left or the right. There are about 45 asteroids that you must dodge. You have three tries to make it to the time warp"

Super Retriss has been defined as what people use to call "a Tetris clone". However that definition is quite ugly and is not inaccurate. Since Tetris was created by a Russian student, and commercialized by Spectrum Holobyte, hundreds of "clones" appeared on the shareware market. Why? Well, the algorithms needed to write a Tetris-like game are not complicated, and almost any "average" student of computer science should be able to write his own version of this popular game. Most of the different versions of the game you find out there are just that: a poorly written version of the game, sometimes with the main purpose of seeing that he or she is able to write a Tetris-like game. I started collecting as many Tetris clones as I could, to evaluate and compare them. But soon I found out that only one out of ten was worth to register. Now I only check out a Tetris clone if I have heard good comments about it. Then, what makes Super Retriss to be so special? Well, first of all, the rules of the game are slightly different from the original Tetris and, as far as I know, no other Tetris clone has implemented the idea of the zones and the flicking block so far. Second, Super Retriss has always used a 256 colors VGA mode, even before the first commercial Tetris game using VGA (Super Tetris by Spectrum Holobyte). Third, Super Retriss is not just a tetris player: You can design your own zones and play them later. Fourth, you don"t play all the time with the same set of blocks: In Super Retriss you play with square blocks, rounded blocks, tiny square blocks... Up to ten different block shapes. And finally Super Retriss now includes SoundBlaster support. All these features (and others that you will soon discover) make of Super Retriss a different game, with appealing colors and sound, far from the regular Tetris clones we are used to see everywhere. And that is why the name of the game is not just Retriss but SUPER Retriss!!

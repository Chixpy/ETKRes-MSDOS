A fun shoot-em-up game. You fight against human or computer opponents in one of 50 single screen arenas by shooting projectiles at them. You can choose one of the 12 characters featuring different weapons and speeds. Very nice graphics and cool gore effects. Unofficial Tournament also supports null-modem cable connection for the second human opponent. Ultimate duel game of this kind. What it really lacks is some sort of story or tournament mode. You can play it only round by round. There is no progress of any sort. No sound effects or music.

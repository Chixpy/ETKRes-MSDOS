One of the strangest games I"ve seen in awhile. By an Italian developer, English documentation and in-game translation is available. The object of the game is described in the manual as follows: "You must collect a given number of certain bonuses and destroy a given percentage of the existing structures, strategically placing bombs of different power, in order to complete each level." Definitely an interesting idea, with decent sprite-based graphics but overall even though this game is unique, probably the gameplay doesn"t have a lot of longevity.

This Farland Story game (chronologically the fifth in the main series) tells a story which is not directly connected to the adventures of Arc and his friends (told in the first three games). In this game, you control Kushna, the 17-year-old princess of Sardis. Two important people wish to marry her: the young Shacliff, prince of the neighbor kingdom Rulphan, and the count Geruda. However, the princess feels she is too young to marry anybody, and escapes the castle, dreaming to find a quiet place where she could practice martial arts. The situation changes somewhat when she accidentally meets prince Shacliff himself and discovers he is in fact quite a nice fellow. And meanwhile, horde of monsters invaded the castle, and there are rumors about a rebellion... 

Although it has a completely different story line, this Farland Story game plays and feels exactly like its predecessors. Once again, you control a party which you can freely move on the battle terrain in turn-based mode. You first assign commands to all your party members, and then wait while the enemies execute their turns. Both you and the enemy automatically counter-attack whenever the attacker is also within the weapon"s range. You gain experience points needed for leveling up directly after each attack.

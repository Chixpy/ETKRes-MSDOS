Legend of Myra is an okay puzzle game of treasure hunting in mazes similar to classic Boulderdash.You control Slimmy the rabbit in this game, as explores mazes full of monsters. Your goal is to tunnel through the rocks to collect precious stones, while avoiding the path that leads to trapped enemies. Along the way, you must collect different-colored keys and negotiate various traps to succeed. A nice game overall, but not as much fun as Boulderdash due to repetitive level design and unforgiving monster locations-- there are so many of them that it often seems impossible to progress. Many levels also have limited space you can make, so there is little room for creative pathmaking: there is only one path you need to make to the exit. Worth a look, but not memorable.

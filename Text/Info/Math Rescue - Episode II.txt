Sort of a sequel to Word Rescue, the mean bad aliens (I think they were aliens) Gruzzles are at it again, this time stealing the numbers of the world. An educational/side-scroller game, Math Rescue has very little gameplay differences with its predecessor, save for the fact that you now solve mathematical puzzles.

This game pits the player as a single man on the prowl for some action. Custom-building the personality and traits of a romantic counterpart, the game can simulate a wide variety of dating experiences, each of which scenarios offers a number of multiple-choice questions yielding an impact on how well the date ultimately went. Over the course of a series of dates that go well, the player can dump flawed girlfriends and seek out ones with more consistent perfection (self-improvement is also a factor; if the girlfriend exceeds her partner, she will be dumping him). A distant goal is to gradually improve both self and partner so as to eventually wrangle invitations to the Big Party, into which only perfect couples are permitted.

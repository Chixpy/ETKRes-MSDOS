Amateur made, shareware imitation of Monkey Island 2 / Simon the Sorceror. But don"t let that put you off - this is a quality game in its own right. You are adventurer Paul Cole, the year is 1948, and you have been lowered down a pit to investigate a the discovery of a corpse. Then you find you cannot get out. The rest is up to you! 

The main difference between this and another LucasArts" SCUMM engine game is the lack of obvious humor. It seems to take itself very seriously.

Magnetic is a decent Reversi variant from The X-ample Architectures, a German developer.The game is basically Reversi, except that you can only change the color of one tile to your color, not the entire range of tiles as in a normal Reversi game. The computer AI in Magnetic puts up a decent fight, and you can play against another human player or against a tough computer player in "Expert Mode" if you really want a challenge. A neat game overall, but nothing special compared to full-featured Reversi/Othello games such as WZebra (which is freeware to boot). The background music is pleasant, though.

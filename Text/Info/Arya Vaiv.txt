There are 4 similar levels further split into two parts. Second part is always harder because the end of it is occupied by huge/powerful boss. You start the mission with a few lives in stock and two problems: the ship is too slow and equipped with basic single fire only. Try to shoot to bits special transport so you"ll be awarded with "Speed Up" (to accelerate movement of your ship) or "Power Up" (to increase power of one and only weapon in this game).

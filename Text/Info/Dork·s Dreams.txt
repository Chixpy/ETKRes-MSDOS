Dork the Dinosaur settles down for a nap beneath a Triassic tree when a thunderstorm stirs up, frightening him.  A lightning bolt hits the tree he"s sheltering beneath, dropping a branch on his head and knocking him out cold.  While he"s unconscious, he dreams... that he is a character in an eight-level platform game.

Each level has a fixed goal -- to reach the exit without touching enemies -- and some levels will feature distinctly non-prehistoric objects (springs, harpoons, bombs, balloons) for assistance in achieving that goal.  Otherwise all Dork has going for him is a little dino shuffle and a little thecodont hop that unfortunately can"t be used in conjunction with the shuffle.

Several philosophical platform of a small dinosaur that fell during the storm a tree and dreams lying underneath. Levels of eight, there are a few lives, enemies should be avoided, sometimes at levels you can find a number of objects (some of which are quite "historical" - the same bomb , say) that can somehow help a dinosaur on the way. Goal - just get to the next level (sometimes it is necessary fairly jump). Distinctive (and weird) feature of the game is that the character can be in complete darkness. colored graphics in the game, but still very sketchy, the game itself is quite complex, and certainly not everyone will like, however, to look at this unusual worth it.

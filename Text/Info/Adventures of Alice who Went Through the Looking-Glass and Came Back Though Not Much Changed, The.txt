Douglas Asherman, of Oakland, California, has won the first Official GAGS Game Contest, sponsored by Mark J. Welch, author of the Generic Adventure Game System*. Asherman"s game is called "Alice," and is patterned after the character invented by Lewis Carroll in the book "Alice in Wonderland." 

Asherman"s game allows a player to play the role of Alice as she goes through the Looking-Glass, and to meet many of the same characters described in Carroll"s book. Asherman also adds some humorous 20th-century perspective to the 19th-century character.

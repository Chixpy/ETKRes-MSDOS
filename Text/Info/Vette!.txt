Race your corvette against another human or computer player through an accurate reproduction of San Francisco.  Choose between store models (stock or ZR1) or a tricked-up "vette (twin turbo or "sledgehammer").

Use your on-screen map display to choose the best route -- there are multiple ways to reach the finish line careening through the streets of San Francisco.  You can also switch between views, including left, right, rearview mirror, with or without dash, helicopter chase cam, or a combination of views.

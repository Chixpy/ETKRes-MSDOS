MarioUp is a nice fanmade Mario Brothers game, coded in QBasic.Your job once again is to guide our plump plumber across the 2D side-scrolling levels, collecting stars while he can and jumping on enemies. The game is very colorful, the animations fluid, and the controls easy to learn. The game unfortunately is a tad too short (only a few levels), and there is no music to speak of. Excellent level design, new graphics (backgrounds, etc.), and a good gameplay that is very faithful to Nintendo"s classic makes the game well worth a look, though. It"s fun as a nice little coffee break game, at least. Too bad Luigi doesn"t make his appearance in this fanmade underdog.

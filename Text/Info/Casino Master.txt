Casino Master is a pretty decent casino game from an unknown developer (if you know who made this game, please let us know).In this "no frills" game, you can play the five mainstay gambling games: craps, blackjack, roulette, poker, and baccarat. Each game is presented in crisp EGA graphics, with some decent computer opponents. That"s really all there is to it, though: no record keeping or tournament mode of any kind, no overview or rules for each game, and no bells or whistles that would set this apart from other, more popular, casino games on the market. But as far as shareware/low-budget casino games go, Casino Master is not bad at all. Worth a look, but if you want a more serious/realistic casino game with recording options, play Beat the House or Villa Crespo"s casino games instead.

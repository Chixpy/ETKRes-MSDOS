A two player artillery game. When I look at it I see a Scorched Earth clone. However, OnTarget came out 4 years ahead of Scorched Earth so it"s probably the other way around. The game has a simple 2D map, and you take turns filing a single missile at each other. You can change the velocity, range, and angle of the shell.

This game is still supported and sold by it"s authors on various shareware websites (but for Windows).

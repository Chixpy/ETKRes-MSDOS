"The MAT-STOMPIN" game that allows you to develop and promote your own wrestling federation!

Imagine owning and operating your own wrestling federation. All the key decisions ranging from what cities to play to what wrestlers work for the federation are yours alone. Your skills determine if the federation makes a profit on each event-- or loses its shirt! 

Pro Wrestling Promoter is my way of giving wrestling fans an opportunity to experience what it is like to be a wrestling promoter. I have been a promoter with a major wrestling company for over two years and have been associated with events throughout the country. Of course I am also a life-long wrestling fan."

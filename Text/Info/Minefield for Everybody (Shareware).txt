"Minefield For Everybody (MFE) is a game of logic and deduction, and a little luck. You are given a field that contains a known number of bombs. Your job is to deduce the exact location of all the bombs.

As you uncover each location in the field, you will be given certain information. If the location contains a bomb, you lose the game. If there are no bombs, then one of two things will happen. If there are any bombs in any of the eight surrounding squares, then you will be told. From this you can slowly deduce the location of all the bombs in the field. If there are no bombs in the eight surrounding squares, then all 8 squares will be revealed. If any of those also have no surrounding bombs, then the area around it will also be revealed. This way a large amount of the map can be cleared at once."

This is one of the few fighting games that follows the Killer Instinct school of fighting, that is: lots of eye candy, techno soundtrack and combo moves that allow you to string together dozens of hits.

Storywise the game puts you in the shoes of a deceased character among a gallery of several equally dead characters competing in hell on a tournament sponsored by Lucifer himself with the grand prize being to return to the mortal plane.

The characters include the standard amount of "real" martial artists like the Bruce Lee clone and the dominatrix, as well as some fantasy characters like demons, vikings, etc. each with his own array of special moves, combos and finishing moves.

Graphically the game pulls some nifty tricks. Backgrounds consist of looping FMV and pre-rendered sprites with pyrotechnic effects, reflecting water, etc.., the camera zooms in and out of the fighters, etc.

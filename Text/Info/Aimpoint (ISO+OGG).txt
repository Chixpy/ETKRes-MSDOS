Aimpoint is set in a future after the United Nations were dissolved and the world re-organized into five big regions. The Asia-Pacific union, which has access to a no-pollution energy source named Edura, utilizes special agents for important infiltration missions. During 20 missions, the player takes control over these units.

Each mission begins by dividing the available soldiers into teams and equipping them with weapons. Each soldier has different capabilities and is better suited for certain weapons. After that the teams are separately deployed into the mission zone. Here the teams and the soldiers are controlled in real-time (selecting them issuing commands with the mouse) in order to kill enemies and solve the mission objectives. Besides enemies, there are also other objects in the game world which can be picked up or interacted with, e.g. first aid kits, memory cards which allow access to new cameras or mounted cameras.

"Jason Jupiter has been called in on the deadly mission of decontaminating the planet Shufti-Arquar III by the Galactic Federation. The fragments of radioactove borxidium naturally form the shape of a golden heart when open to the air.

Unfortunately Jason couldn"t get to the planet quick enough to stop some of the creatures on Shufti-Arquar III becoming terribly mutated and ferocious. The main offender is called the Glutanous-Green-Groted-Gronge. This wasn"t the most friendly creature in the first place, but now its too ferocious to describe. (By the way don"t let its name deceive you, it"s Purple). Another mutation that will cause Jason a problem is a plant called the Horrible-Herbaceous-Headeating-Honkhider. One touch from this and it gets the taste of your flesh."

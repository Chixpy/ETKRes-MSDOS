Break Machine is a break-out game in 320*400 MODEX Vga. In another dimension the world Brickania exists. The main component of this world is The Brick. Some monsters came from this world to build the earth a big wall. The earthlings decided to destroy this atmospheric wall. As the fighter for earth you take control of the X-PAD 01 ship which is designed for "Space Bricks Breaking".

You start the game with two balls. Many monsters will try to stop you on your quest. The full version of the game comes with 50 levels and 5 monsters. The shareware version features only 5 levels and 2 monsters. At every fifth level you will meet Worm-TRO, the Brickanian dicator. The game features three types of bricks: Normal ones, tri-flex bricks (you have to hit them three times) and transparent bricks which are indestructible. There are plenty of bonus items such as multi-ball, extra-ball and laser.

FUE is a hard game to describe.  Set in a maze startlingly like
that of WIZARDY, it is really much different.  The FIRX Underground Empire
is the headquarters and factory of a large, magical-technical corporation
gone to seed.  Abandoned, more or less, for untold centuries, it is the home
of strange creatures, unusual machines, the odd magical effect, and a large
and bizarre maze.  I even get lost in it, and I created the damn thing.
        You won"t know what the object of the game is until you play for a
while.  You"ll have to use logic and your powers of deduction.  You have to
be patient, and willing to die now and then.  You have to be stubborn.
        FUE is semi-animated and time plays a factor.  Anything you do in
FUE remains done.  Sometimes events seem to happen at random, as in real
life.  Sometimes luck, good and bad, is very important.

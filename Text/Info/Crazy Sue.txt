Another artifact - DOS-port classic Amiga platformer plotless, which we play for a girl named Sue. Gameplay is quite standard for a platformer - side view, the task - to pass sequentially rather short, but it is sometimes very difficult levels where you may run a lot , jump and collect power-ups to increase the gaming account. The transition from level to level through locked doors, that you want to look for clues. Naturally, the game has all sorts of traps and enemies (mainly - "forest" entourage). The nice thing is that the levels are really different, with different dangers and creatures. In the case of the death of Sue is automatically transferred to the top level. Graphically the game looks nice - a beautiful and clear picture painted, bright backgrounds. Formally game can even be called a good and quite suitable for children, but still it should be noted that very soon it becomes quite difficult. Unfortunately, DOS-port of this game - perhaps worst of all artisanal and that when -or does (almost certainly informal, by the way). So there is not only the other (though bright, yet others) levels backgrounds, but a lot of bugs. For example, sometimes there is a discrepancy between the sprites, or even their absence (as in the case with these doors). However, you can play it (although if you can get from this game a real pleasure - the second question). Verdict - good, nice and entertaining visual thing, the main value of which is, however, the collector (but nice to see all the fans of the old games it is, of course, not the only reason).

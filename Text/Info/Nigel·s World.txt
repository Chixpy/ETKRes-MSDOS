Nigel"s World is a fun educational title that fulfills what its subtitle (Adventures in Geography) implies, despite obvious borro-- err-- inspiration from Carmen Sandiego series.In this game designed for kids ages 7 and up, your job is to help professional photographer Nigel take pictures from around the world to help him win First Place in a photography contest.  Nigel"s World teaches valuable map skills and strengthens problem solving, critical thinking, and reading skills. Your child will be entertained by animated cartoons and actual photographs accompanied by international folk songs and digitized speech in 17 languages. Although it is more derivative than innovative, Nigel"s World"s very high production values and a vast variety of locations to visit should help kids learn geography while having fun.

SFB2: Vector Warriors is a Fighting game coded in QBASIC Extended. Unlike other BASIC fighting games that look bad, play bad and are deleted often, I slaved over SFB2 untill I had a game that"s fun and easy to play yet unique. 

It"s not another wanna-be Mortal Kombat (Which I personally don"t like as a game). 

Two fighters get put in a given stage and beat the piss out of each other until one of them wins the match or is dead.
 
Matches are best out of three rounds. When one of the fighters KO the other they win the round. 

On some stages the fighters may step out of the ring resulting in a Ring Out. This may result in the opponent winning the round or some kind of an ass kicking. 

In the event of a death, the fighter still living wins the match regardless of how many rounds anyone has won.

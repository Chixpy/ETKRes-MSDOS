Looks like someone has gone and abandoned some poor astronauts on a desolate planet again. It"s your job to swoop them up and bring "em home in Meteor Mission. In this fixed perspective arcade game you control the rocket ship as it drops from the mother-ship. You will direct the rocket with your boosters and make a soft landing on the surface. As you land on the pad you will automatically pick up an astronaut. 

The second part of your mission will come where you must guide the rocket back into the mother-ship. All the while avoiding meteors floating about the screen. On your ascent you will thankfully have a laser gun running that you can shoot form the nose of your ship but on the descents you will just have to be nimble fingered. Rescuing all your astronauts will advance you to the next level where you will have to deal with even more meteors but you"ll also get upgraded fire-power!

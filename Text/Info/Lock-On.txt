Lock-On is one of the few Quicksilver arcade conversions that were not released on the console systems, making it one of the least known Data East games in existence.That is perhaps for the best, though, as the game is just an average arcade flight simulator without much to distinguish it from other shoot-em-ups. Shoot down waves after waves of enemies while evading their fire. Despite the game"s pretense at being a flight "sim" by including authentic-looking gauges and radar, flight sim fans will frown on the game"s total disregard of aerodynamics principles. Overall, a mindless first-person shooter that might be fun for a while... a very short while.

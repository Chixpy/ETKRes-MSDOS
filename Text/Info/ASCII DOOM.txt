If indeed DOOM can be boiled down to shooting people with a shotgun from a first-person perspective while running around a maze, then this minimalist proof-of-concept delivers what it promises. Anyone hoping for anything more (such as the eminently DOOMian demons, keycards, gates, exploding barrels, multiple weapons, sound effects, power-ups or deathmatches) may be disappointed. Admittedly this is more interesting as a kind of technical demo than as a game, flying with authentic ASCII art stickmen where later Quake fans took the lazy way out with use of aalib. (On the other hand, it remains far more graphically sophisticated than Doom, the Roguelike!)

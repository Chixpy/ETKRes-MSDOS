Evidence of a new and unknown civilization has been found. The ultimate goal for your starship and crew is to avoid Klingon suspicion and make First Contact. In the process of contacting this new civilization, you must carry diplomats to the planet of Gothica to ensure the Federation makes a good impression. GOOD LUCK!

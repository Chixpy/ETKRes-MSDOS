As its name implies, M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration is a conquer "n" plunder-type strategy game in the same vein as the Warcraft or Command & Conquer series, albeit with a few interesting twists. The goal of M.A.X. is to colonize newly-discovered planets, controlling the resources found there, and defend your colony against other rival factions looking to literally blow you off the planet.

M.A.X. is most notable for its ability to be played as a real-time or more traditional turn-based strategy game, which can significantly impact how the game is played.  The length of turns is adjustable, as is game speed, so the game can be as challenging or brain-dead as the player wants. But at its core, M.A.X. is about resource-gathering, building, and tactical combat.  The game offers more than 50 land, sea, and air units, most of which can be upgraded to improve their armor, speed, and range.  You can play as one of eight different Factions (all of which are explained in a rather lengthy fictional introduction in the manual), either in a complete campaign or in a limitless number of custom missions.  There"s also a tutorial campaign to get new players up to speed on the myriad unit and building options.

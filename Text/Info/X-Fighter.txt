A fun little freeware gem from David Bayliss, X-Fighter is a simple top-down shoot-em-up that is deal for a few minutes of simple, clean arcade fun in 4-color graphics.Gameplay can be summed up in two words: shoot everything. It?s not original by any means, but still quite fun, especially with various types of enemy fighters that have different movement patterns, etc. Overall, another forgotten early freeware title rescued from the depths of time ? especially for old-timers who miss the good old days of BBS before the dawn of the Internet :-)

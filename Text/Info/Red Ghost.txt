A new enemy has risen from secret bases throughout the world. Armed with the latest in military technology, Red Ghost is aiming at world domination. You will command eighteen of the world"s most elite group of fighting men to stop this threat.

Red Ghost blends the elements of a traditional isometric/top-down strategy game with elements of 3D first-person perspective games. You will use your tactical skills in the overhead stages to plan your attack, however when the battles begin you"ll have the ability to commandeer jeeps, tanks, helicopters and ground artillery units for close combat from the first-person perspective. 

Red Ghost is one of the early showcases of the CD-ROM format. By taking full advantage of the medium the developers were able to add Silicon Graphics cinematics and CD quality sound effects and music.

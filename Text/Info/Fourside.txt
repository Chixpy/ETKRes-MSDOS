Fourside is a neat little ASCII-based Dominoes variant, released as one of the games on an issue of SoftDisk"s "Big Blue Disk" monthly disk magazine.The game plays like Dominoes, except that the Dominoes tiles are 4-sided, making it much more difficult to match the sides. Fortunately, the game includes multiple difficulty levels: on the easiest levels, you need to match only numbers from 1 to 3. On harder levels, the full integer spectrum from 1-9 is used. If you enjoy a neat little brainteaser with no reflex requirements or time constraints, check out this quaint and interesting puzzle variant of a common board game.

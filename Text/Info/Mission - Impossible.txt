Not to be confused with similar-sounding Impossible Mission action game from Epyx, Mission: Impossible is the adventure game that puts you in command of a 4-man spy team.You can control separate members, ordering them to do different things at once. In fact, the spies *must* be given individual orders to solve many puzzles in the game. Track suspects, tap phones, infiltrate terrorist offices, and more. The game features a vast overhead map similar to Police Quest 1, real-time gameplay, and an involving plot that develops as you unearth more clues. Save often!

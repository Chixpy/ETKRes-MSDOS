Wanton Destruction is one of two authorized add-on packs for Shadow Warrior that were canceled during development and later released as freeware.

It adds three new Wang Bang-levels, a Capture The Flag-level and a new episode: Wanton Destruction. This episode features twelve new maps; also, some enemies now have different graphics.

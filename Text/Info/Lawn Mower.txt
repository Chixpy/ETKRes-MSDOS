Lawn Mower is a text-only action game, in which you play, well, a lawn mower. Of course, this is not too interesting in itself, so there are some catches. 

First of all, you have to mow the entire lawn in a certain time. Furthermore, you earn money for mowing, and the less time you need, the more you earn. To save time, you can change the mowing speed, but be careful: if you go too fast, you"ll hit some things not intended to mow, thereby getting a time penalty and damaging the mower. After ten "hits", you must replace the blades of the mower by returning to the starting shed.

The whole thing is further complicated by different obstacles. A gopher appears randomly and leaves holes, and at advanced levels, a dog begins to chase you -- all destroy your mower on touch. Every destroyed mower costs you 10 dollars, and you only have a limited number of mowers at your disposition.

The first levels may seem easy, but don"t get fooled: it soon gets pretty hard. The game ends when all your mowers are gone, and if mowed well enough, you get the possibility of getting into a high score list.

Super Mario may be a plumber, but is Mario a Super Plumber?  Stand aside, goomba-smasher -- no platform game this, instead it"s a textmode implementation of the solid gold (copper and lead might make more sense) puzzler Pipe Mania.  What that means is that you are given a series of differently-shaped pipe segments, and have to lay them down to form a sequence on a 10x10 grid so as to ensure the longest continuous fluid flow through them. Unlike Pipe Mania, tiles can"t be replaced with others once they have been placed, however you can exterminate the active tile by pressing K. Scoring is 25 points per square used, with 50 for using the second side of a cross.

Tynesoft were almost certainly the first people to try a first person  pinball game with this ambitious program. Up to four players could join in, including 2 computer players to show you how it"s done. The game can be played from a more traditional overhead-view mode, which makes it easier to tell where the bumpers are in relation to the flippers, and is recommended for learning the game. Most of those bumpers are single-colour and arranged in a straightforward pattern. There are three different gameplay speeds and 2 possible levels of ball bounce.

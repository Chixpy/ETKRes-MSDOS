CrossWorld: LA Times Edition is a fun and comprehensive crossword puzzle game for DOS.Featuring a whole year"s worth of crossword puzzles from LA Times, the game also includes a full-featured crossword creator you can use to make your own puzzles. The game goes above and beyond other crossword programs by including a surprisingly complete dictionary that has many archaic words, as well as a powerful built-in anagram solver that helps you see all the valid words that can be formed by given alphabets. 

Although CrossWorld is DOS based, it has a Windows-like icon-based menu that is a breeze to use. One of the features I like most is the automatic checking - the game marks any wrong letter you type with a cross, so you immediately know if you are on the right track or not. There are also several kinds of hints, depending on how much you want to be spoiled. Overall, CrossWorld is definitely one of the better crossword puzzle games I have ever come across. If you"re a fan of this fun time waster, check out this highly underrated and little-known PC version. Highly recommended! Be sure to also check out the better sequel CrossWorld 2 on this site :)

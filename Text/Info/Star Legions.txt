Star Legions is the third installment in the Star Fleet gaming universe.  Star Legions is much narrower in focus than its predecessors, though; you are charged with managing the planetary invasion forces of the Krellan Empire against the "evil" (good?) United Galactic Alliance.  The result is a bit like playing Empire in a sci-fi environment.

Success in the initial invasions means promotions, personal honors, and even greater armies to command in future campaigns.

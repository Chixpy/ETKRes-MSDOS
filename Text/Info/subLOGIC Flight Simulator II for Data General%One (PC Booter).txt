SubLOGIC Flight Simulator II for Data General/One is the very rare version for one of the first laptops in the world. The version is only monochromatic. Start the Flight Simulator and when the introduction screen appears, select screen mode A \u2013 slightly textured sky. Then select operation mode B \u2013 regular flight mode. Press F2 to get full throttle. Your plane will go and take off. Use cursor keys to control the plane. The detailed control keyboard map is here (they are included keyboard maps for next versions).

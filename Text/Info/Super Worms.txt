First of all, this game has nothing to do with the classic WORMS games by Team17/Microprose. It is actually quite similar to the classic SNES game "Super Mario Kart". In this game you race your worm around a racing track (okay, sure, makes sense to me) against other worms. On the way you can pickup powerup items (ala Mario Kart) to use against the other racers. It"s a very well polished, professional game, however the shareware version contains only the first five tracks out of the total of 20 tracks in the full version.

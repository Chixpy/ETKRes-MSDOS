INTERCEPT starts with you on the street in front of a car and a phone booth.  If you look closely at your possessions, you see you have an ID card (not for buying alcohol) and a watch.  Now, if you type in the correct command, you can get into the car.  Once you"re inside the car, what do you do?  Get out, go into the phone booth, call your friend to find out how to start the car?  You"ll have to discover what to do on your own.

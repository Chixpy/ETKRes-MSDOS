"This computer game is a clone of the Parker Brothers board game Risk, but played on a map of the United States. The rules of this game and rules of the board game are very similiar (but not identical).

When you win a battle, you gain propaganda cards which can be traded for armies. In the beginning of the game, you can set the maximum number of armies to any number between 10 and 99. You can also opt for reinforcements. When there are two players, player 3 is neutral. All die-rolling, card-dealing, and army- and state-counting is done by the computer."

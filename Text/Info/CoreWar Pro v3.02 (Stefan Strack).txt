CoreWar Pro is an implementation of the game Core Wars for PC-compatibles. Core War was introduced by A.K.Dewdney in the Computer Recreations column in Scientific American (later compiled in his book "The Armchair Universe"). Under the supervision of MARS (the Memory Array Redcode Simulator) battle programs written in an assembly-like language (Redcode) fight for memory space in a circular virtual memory array (the Core).

CoreWar Pro is an integrated environment for writing, debugging and running Redcode programs. The Redcode interpreter supports a superset of the International Core War Standard of 1988 (ICWS"88). A built-in preprocessor facilitates writing of Redcode programs. Battles of up to 63 programs can be run in a variety of user-configurable execution modes, including a full-screen display, single-step debugging, break- and watchpoints. An integrated Core Editor allows inspecting and modifying the contents of the Core during execution.

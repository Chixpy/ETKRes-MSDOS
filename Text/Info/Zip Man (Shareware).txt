"This game has no story. I guess you control a guy, who for some reason is in a place with fires, and collects jewels.

The game has several registration options, but I expect it didn"t sell... well any copies.

From the anonymous (only gives a handle) author:

- YOU MAY SOMETIMES FIND THAT YOU GO THROUGH WALLS HEY NOBODY"S PERFECT..
- SOME VGA MONITORS DO NOT SUPPORT MY PERFECT FUNCTIONS THEREFORE SOME PEOPLE WILL SEE EVERYTHING IN 100% TERRIBLE COLOR.. SO IF IT LOOKS REALLY HORRIBLE YOU KNOW WHY!!!
- SOME VGAs DON"T SUPPORT HARDWARE FADES THEREFORE IF IT DOESN"T WORK ON YOUR MACHINE.. SORRY..
- THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON VGA MONITORS.. YOU EGA & CGA PEOPLE NEED TO GO BUY A VGA..
- IF IT FREEZES THEN YOU KNOW A FILE WAS MISNAMED OR DELETED!!"

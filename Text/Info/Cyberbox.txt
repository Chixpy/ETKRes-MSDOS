CyberBox is a game where you push around boxes to try to get to the exit. Despite it"s somewhat lacking graphics, it is innovative because of the many different types of boxes and the many different puzzle areas. It"s also fairly easy to configure, so you can tailor it to your own tastes. (Note: The full title of this game is "The Continuing Adventures of Cyberbox", and it is a remake of the original game by Doug Beeferman. Visit his site to download the original, and its sequel, Cyberbox2!)

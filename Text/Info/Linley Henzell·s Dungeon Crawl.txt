Dungeon Crawl is an open source roguelike game originally developed by Linley Henzell.  In March of 1999, Linley entered law school and gave over the maintanence duty to a group who call themselves the Crawl DevTeam. 

Dungeon Crawl allows the player to choose a race and class for his character, then the character is set loose in a dungeon.  The eventual goal of the game is to retrieve the Orb of Zot from the depths of the dungeon and escape with it for fame and the people"s ovation forever.

Some of Crawl"s interesting features include: complex skill system, religion with many gods, unique magic spells, and many optional, themed side dungeons.

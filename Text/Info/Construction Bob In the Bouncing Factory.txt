Construction Bob is an all-star favorite construction stuntman who works in the bouncing factory. But his job is not easy, as he must bounce over and over to collect parts of items. You play the part of Construction Bob"s two assistants who help him catch the items. C.B.I.T.B.F is an action-packed game that features splendid (and sometimes disgusting) VGA graphics. It also features a "PG-13" mode wich is not for the faint of heart... and for little kids, the "G" mode is a good way to play the game without making them sick. Bounce your your way through 50 level of jumping action.

The Blue Planet 2000 is a 4X game and could be described as Civilization variant. The game starts in 6000 B.C. and the player controls a nation during its way through history. The faction expands over the planet (either Earth or a randomly generated environment) by founding new cities and interacting with other factions either with diplomacy or force. Other important aspects are resource management, keeping the citizens happy and researching new developments until the nation is ready for space travel. The handling is mostly number and icon based, e.g. the icons on the world map are moved by pressing directional arrows on the menu bar.

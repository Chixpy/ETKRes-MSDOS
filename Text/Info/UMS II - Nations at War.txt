Sequel to the original Universal Military Simulator of 1988, this release continues the game concept of its predecessor and allows the player total control of nearly every aspect of a battle.

In the original program, three scenarios are included: Invasion of the Allies in Normandy 1944, Battles of Alexander the Great in 334 B.C. and Napoleon\u00b4s greatest battles at Trafalgar, Austerlitz, Borodino and Waterloo.

Also included is the UMS Planet Edition which lets the player create their own scenarios.

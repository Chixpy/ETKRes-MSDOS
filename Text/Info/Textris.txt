The included documentation describes Textris as follows: "Textris is a cross between Tetris and Scrabble. The idea is to form words from falling letter tiles." That"s a pretty good description of this game. Letter tiles drop, Tetris-style, into the playing field, and your goal is to spell as many words as possible. Longer words = more points. Decent graphics, and it does seem to work since it includes a decent dictionary of words.

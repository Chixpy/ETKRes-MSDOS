Dungeon Thief is essentially a simple ASCII-based maze game. Only a small portion of the maze is revealed at a time, and you must avoid the various baddies and find your way to the exit while collecting treasure. There isn"t too much more to the game than that really, but it"s a low-stress exercise to be sure. There"s also a lot of text contained within the menu, including the designer"s philosophy on game design and other mildly boring tidbits. (Run the game in color by typing "DTDEMO COLOR" at the command prompt.)

Before we get to the technical stuff, a word about controls. Make sure that NumLock is on. You will find that the menus do not react to the arrow keys, everything in this game is controlled with the numeric keypad. You could use the standard number keys, but that would be a pointless exercise.

David Auber patched both the game and the sound setup utility so that they will run under XP, or rather, on a fast computer; they had the usual Turbo Pascal 7.0 runtime error 200, which will occur on very fast Pentium, Pentium II or above. The original executables are included in the archive as BANG.EX and SOUNDSETUP.EX. If you want to play Bang under DOSBox or on a computer that is slow enough, use the old executable (for the game\u2014it really doesn"t matter for the setup).

If you want to hear the music, it becomes a bit tricky. It works fairly well in DOSBox. You"ll have to wait rather long for the first level to load, and when it does, there"s a whistling noise for a short while. Then, both game and music play flawlessly. Under 9x, it works less well. If you run the game with sound enabled, you will be prompted to run it in pure MS-DOS. If you ignore this, the sound quality will be abysmal.

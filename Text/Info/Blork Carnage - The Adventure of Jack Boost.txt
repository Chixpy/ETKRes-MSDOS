Mr. Jack Boost,

As chairman of the 3rd Continent, I hold you liable for damages caused by your brother.

I quote:

* Unauthorized reproduction of Blorks.
* Transformation of their genes.
* Degradation of the First and Second Continents.
* Illegal detention [illegible] -tres galactic, aliens and human hostages. 

I beg you to return to Earth to bring order here.

S. Valenti "

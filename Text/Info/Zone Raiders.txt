Zone Raiders is a futuristic hovercar racing combat game set in a 3D environment. The protagonist is a freelance Raider who ventures into the dangerous Free Zone, where rare and expensive items can be scavenged. Getting those items, however, won"t be easy: other raiders are headed towards the Zone with the same intention, and the hero must race them, using all means to get there first. The futuristic cars resemble those that were used in the 20th century, with an important difference: they are equipped with hover plates and heavy weaponry. The protagonist should search for new weapons, shield regenerators, jet packs, and jet packs, as he races and sabotages opponent cars.

The game features sixteen different tracks, five selectable hovercars (one of them hidden), and eight usable weapons. Multiplayer can be accessed through IPX Network, two-player modem, or serial support, and can accommodate up to eight players.

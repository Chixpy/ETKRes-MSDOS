Endless Horror"s modest EGA graphics and small executable size ensure that the game can be run on virtually any IBM-PC machine, regardless of age.The characters are line-based, similar to the characters in the Stick Fighter games. Unfortunately, the game offers poor character control and a seemingly endless amount of creepy enemies. However, I used to quite enjoy playing it on my IBM-PC XT-8088 a few years back. This game is worth a try if you"ve got an older system on hand which hasn"t seen a fighting game before, or if you"re a diehard collector (like myself).

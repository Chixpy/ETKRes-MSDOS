An instant real-time multiplayer-only keyboard-crowding (or network) classic, this game pits up to four human-operated cute fuzzy widdle bunnies against each other for one goal only: lagomorphic cranial domination.

Against a pastoral Warner Bros. backdrop (or any of over a hundred fan-made levels!) these rabbits re-enact 2D platform Joust glories minus the lava, eggs and ostriches; in short, the players pursue each other -- now hunting, now hunted, the tables turned at the blink of an eye -- aiming to exploit variable special landscape features of slippery ice, delaying water and elevating springboards to their advantage.

Points are scored by jumping on other bunnies" heads, to great (and gory) effect; a running tally of head-squishings is kept, with flattened players continually re-spawning.

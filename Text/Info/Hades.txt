With Hades, Ablex continued to walk untrodden paths, this time by trying to combine FPS elements obviously inspired by Doom with a 3D flight sim/shooter like Terminal Velocity or Fury\u00b3. It was the first real-time 3-D action arcade game made in Korea. Dogfight battle screens and close combat is reminiscent of Comanche. Actual voice sampling and thrilling sound effects are implemented. It has original and exciting game scenarios, the ability to zoom-in, zoom-out, the use of a horizontal radar, and various view modes to select.

Acid Tetris is a freeware Tetris clone, true to the original version. There is only one game mode, where you guide an unlimited amount of falling bricks to form complete rows until you hit the top of the screen. After reaching a certain amount of points, the speed of the bricks is increased. This difficulty level can also be set from the start in the main game menu. 

There are a few features that make this game stand out. The bricks are colorful and upon removing a line, a yellow smiley appears with a different expression and sound depending on the amount of rows you removed with a single brick. On the right is an overview of the amount of different bricks used. There is a high score table and the game features both up-tempo and relaxing music, including a remake of the classic Tetris song.

NOTA: El juego se controla con los cursores y las teclas A y S.

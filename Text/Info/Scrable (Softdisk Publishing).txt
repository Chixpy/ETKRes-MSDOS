This game centers around rearranging the letters of words.  It has several different modes.  In the standard game, a word is presented and the player must find as many words as possible by mixing around letters from the word.  In the "anagrams only" game, things work much like the standard game, but the player must use all of the letters of the word to make new words; subsets are not allowed.  In "?-letter words only," the player may only create words of a specified length.  Finally, in "unscramble," the word"s letters are initially displayed as a jumble and the player must rearrange them.  When the player quits, the game displays any answers that were missed and gives statistics regarding play.

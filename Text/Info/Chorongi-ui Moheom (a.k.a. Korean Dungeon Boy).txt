Before Choe Wanseop was contracted by Hyundai for the never released Hwarang Sogong, he made himself a name with this popular freeware dungeon crawler in Hercules graphics. The principle is simple. The hero has to find the exit of each dungeon floor before a timer runs out, but also needs to take care not running out of ammunition or batteries, which fuel his primary weapon, armor and radar. Powerups for those lie around on the dungeon floor, but the hunt for those items is disturbed by a number of hostile creatures. Enemies are aimed at with a keyboard-controlled cursor. Still, the game doesn"t feel quite like a shooter, maybe more akin to a realtime action RPG. [Hardcore Gaming 101]

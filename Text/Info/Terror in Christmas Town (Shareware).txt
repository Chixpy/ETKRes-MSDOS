Ever felt the need to rescue a kidnapped elf who has been captured by a evil polar bear? No, me neither. Yet, in Wolfenstein-like 3D, that"s exactly the premise of this game. Although you use heavy weaponry (shotguns and so on) this is not a gory game. The graphics, sounds and gameplay are all fairly basic. The graphics have a mildly winter/Christmas related theme, and there is an inventory system that is a bit more complex than usual in games of this type. Probably worth trying if you enjoy early 3D shooting games.

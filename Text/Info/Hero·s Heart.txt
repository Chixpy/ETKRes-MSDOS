Hero"s Heart is a game where you play the role of a hero and you have to collect all of the hearts in a level before proceeding to to next level. There are 25 levels. To collect the hearts, you have to solve a series of puzzles such as, how to turn a blue heart to red, how to get four spaces over water with only three blocks, and what order to do things in. There are many more obstacles such as boulders, arrows, balloons, monsters, and fire. You have to solve the puzzles to get to the hearts. Many times, you have to do things in a certain order or the other heart will become blocked by obstacles. This game is sort of like Chip"s Challenge.

Hero"s Heart also has a level editor with all of the obstacles that are in the game. You can change the background, the music, and make unique levels. Hero"s Heart requires a lot of thinking so you can solve the puzzles. Then when you finish a level, you can do it again and try to get the least amount of moves. Hero"s Heart is a shortened version of Hero"s Gold, which includes more obstacles and levels.

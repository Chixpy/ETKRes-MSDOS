Dig Dug is a great PC port of Namco"s coin-op classic of the same name, ported by Atari.You are Dig Dug, an intrepid gardener whose soil is infested with pesky Pookas and fire-breathing Fygars. You"re armed with your trusty pump, which you can use to inflate your enemies until, finally, they blow up. But both the Pookas and Fygars can crawl through the ground and can pop out into your tunnels, and if a Fygar sneaks up behind you, he can toast you if you"re not careful. Like other arcade classics, the game is easy to learn but hard to master and highly addictive. A must-have, but not as timeless a classic as Windmill"s Digger.

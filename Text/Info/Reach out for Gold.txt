Ever dreamt of becoming an Olympic champion? Now your dreams can come true. All you need to do is to Reach Out For Gold.

There are 8 events in which you have to compete in order to achieve the final victory! If you don\u2019t do well enough in an event, you won\u2019t qualify for the next one. It is therefore a good idea to practice. The events are as follows:

Skeet Shooting - You look like a small hunter, ready to shoot some skeet. You have to be very careful though, as you only get one bullet per each skeet, so don\u2019t miss!

100m Running - This is plain and simply a dash. You need to quickly press left and right in order go gain speed. The first one to reach the finish \u2013 wins.

Archery - Three guys wanted to show off their archery skills. The first hit the bull\u2019s eye and said: \u201cI\u2019m William Tell!\u201d The second one split his arrow and said: \u201cI\u2019m Robin Hood!\u201d The third one missed the target and hit an innocent bystander and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll be \u2013because it\u2019s really easy to miss the target, if you don\u2019t consider the wind and don\u2019t calculate your strength right.

Long Jump - It\u2019s just what is says. You need to get a good running start and jump at a right angle in order to make a looong jump.

Boxing - There are several opponents and you need to beet the crap out of them to win. Not many fighting moves though.

Javelin - Similar to the long jump, only that this time you needn\u2019t jump, but throw the javelin at the right angel and watch it fly!

Swimming - Again a speed competition, only this time you\u2019ll need to repeatedly press fire to gain speed.

Kayak - This is probably the most original event I\u2019ve seen. By moving left or right you paddle either on the left or the right side of the boat. This is used both for moving and steering. The object is to get to the finish in as little time as possible, while passing all the gates. You will however have to fight the water current as well!

All in all this is a fun game, with many comical moments (like the skeet shooting guy getting angry at you and shooting you through the screen), yet it\u2019s still a solid sports game on its own. It has very nice graphics and well done sounds including some speech. It allows you up to 4 players. When you decide you\u2019ve practiced enough and start competing, you\u2019ll also be able to select among many different countries to compete for \u2013 or simply choose the Olympic flag if none of the countries suit you.

So enjoy this great but fairly unknown game, maybe even invite 3 friends over and see who\u2019ll get the gold in the end (or at least an arrow while shooting with the bow).

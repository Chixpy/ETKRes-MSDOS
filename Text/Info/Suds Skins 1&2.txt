This is an adult adventure game.

It"s about Johnny"s return to Soho Hotel to meet the people he knew on Parts I and Interlude I.

It all goes good, but Johnny gets involved in a mystery.

I released a very early demo in September 2000 which got reviewed at VPlanet. It has an award: QB Gamming Gold 2001, best babe: Sandra. It was only a taste of how it is now. Parts 3 & 4 are still to come, so enjoy these :)

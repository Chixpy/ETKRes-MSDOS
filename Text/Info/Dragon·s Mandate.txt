Dragon"s Mandate is another game similar in gameplay to Adventure on the Atari, just as my old Dragon"s Domain games were, though this one is a far superior program. :-) Basically you are a knight on a quest to recover the chalice. To do so, you will need to find the keys to unlock various gates, and find your way through mazes and dungeons, while avoiding getting killed by dragons, skeletons, and fire elementals.

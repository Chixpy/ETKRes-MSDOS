"This game was initially inspired by memories of a similar game, Tiger Tank, which I played many years ago on an Ohio computer. Back in those days, this game came on tape and took about 3 minutes to load.

Tiger Tank is an acarde / action game which puts you in a battle field with enemy tanks. All you have, is your skill and fast reflexes to get you past each level. The objective of the game is very simple, just shot anything that moves. Note, unlike Tiger Tank 1.0, the computer"s tanks are much more vicious now. Their sole purpose is to make their way towards you and they will shoot away walls that are in their way. Once you are within or near their ""sights"", they fire endlessly. However, evading them is not as difficult as you may think. They do have some shortfalls, and it"s up to you to figure out your strategy against them. "

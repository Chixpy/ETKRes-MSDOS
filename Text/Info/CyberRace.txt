In the far future wars are a thing of the past, disputes and conflicts between races are now settled on the "CyberRace", a futuristic everything-goes series of sled races.

The game puts you in the role of Shaw, the son of a terran CyberRace champion who was killed in a suspicious accident. As you enter the competition to try and avenge your father, a conflict of interests explodes around a misterious wormhole, and you are dragged to it by a terran technocrat that forces you to race for the terran cause by kidnnaping your girl.

The game consists of racing in several voxel-space created stages and gaining money while at the same time trying to get your girl back and uncover the plot behind the CyberRace. The races are played from a 1st person perspective, and features the designs of famed artist/designer Syd Mead.

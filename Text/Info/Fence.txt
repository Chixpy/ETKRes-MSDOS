This rare kind of game can be considered a simulator shepherds, although in reality it is more complicated. Your goal - to build fences and the whole design of the fence, not to give your sheep to escape. Horizontal movement of the game (sheep moving behind walls, and can walk and on water), in the same direction and the landscape changes. Build a fence can be immediately in eight directions. Perspective view - isometric, graphics - fantastically beautiful for shareware-game: let the sheep, shepherd and other objects and drawn fine enough, but it is so clear that one can only wonder. Unfortunately, this game is very difficult because of the detail it truly unique theme and gameplay - there are still games that need it to play to understand all their charm.

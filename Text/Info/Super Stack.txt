It is not so easy to explain the rules for this game without some demonstration, so there are 7 tutorial levels to help with that. But lets try anyways:

The object of the game is to decrease the counter (which is located above the game wizard - at the bottom left of the screen) until it reaches zero - then you win.

How? Its a simple task: All you have to do, is to "trap" stars between objects - each star trapped will decrease the counter by one.

Every turn, a block falls from the sky (Tetris like) and you mask rotate it and move it to the place you want it to settle.

Unlike Tetris, the blocks are always made from two pieces, each piece is one of the five different pieces of the game (each shall be explained later).

Also unlike Tetris, once one of the blocks pieces touches the ground, the other pieces keeps on falling until it also reaches the ground (but you can"t control it).

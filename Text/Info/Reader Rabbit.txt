One of The Learning Company"s early edutainment classics, Reader Rabbit is a fun and timeless game designed to teach 3-7 kids reading and spelling skills.There are four different word games to play in the order of increasing difficulty: a word sorter, a picture labeler, the word train, and a variant of the memory game. All four games are very accessible, with pleasant graphics and just the right difficulty level to encourage kids to play more. If you are looking for a fun language game to teach your kids basic reading and spelling skills (if they are already good at recognizing the alphabets), you would be hard pressed to find a much better program than Reader Rabbit - truly a wonderful edutainment program that is still as much fun today as it was in 1989. Highly recommended!

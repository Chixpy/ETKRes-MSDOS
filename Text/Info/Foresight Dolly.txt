Foresight Dolly is a role-playing game that can be described as "light". The player controls Dolly who travels through interconnected areas, most of which consisting of dungeon-like passages. Dolly can equip a weapon and one item as armor. Enemies are visible on screen, and contact with them triggers a turn-based battle, where Dolly can attack physically or use special techniques. Experience and money are gained from combat. The game also has a day and night cycle; Dolly and Amy would automatically go to sleep late in the evening, restoring Dolly"s hit points.

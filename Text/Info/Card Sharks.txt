Based on a popular television show at the time it was released, Card Sharks is a question and answer guessing game in which you compete against a computer player or another "live person".

Questions are asked based upon a poll of 100 people. You must guess how many out of 100 answered Yes or No.  Your opponent then has the chance to guess whether the true answer is higher or lower than your answer.  If you are right, you are taken to the "Cards" screen to play a video version of the "High Low" card game. Guessing correctly lets you keep control of the board, and the next question.  If you lose, your opponent receives the next question.  If you win enough times, you"ll go to the "Big Bucks" card screen where you can bet all or part of your winnings on a more elaborate board of "High Low".

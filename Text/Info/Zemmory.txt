A rather poor memory game. It"s done in pure QBasic featuring poor graphics (card images are letters of different color). It also features few annoying bugs. Single player only game.

".bas format.  If you want to modify it then please give me credit still.
"Spent alot of time on this game and it still got some bugs but I"m workin
"on fixing them. If you"re able to make it an .exe I"d be thankful if you"d
"send it to me. Also if you can fix the bug that turns the matches back over
"when clicked then I"d be thankful for that too.  Feel free to read the code

"games.    Thankx..

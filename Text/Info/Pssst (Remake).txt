Pssst is an outstanding remake of the classic Spectrum game of the same name.Gameplay typifies the style that Ultimate Play the Game was famous for: simple, yet addictive. You play Robbie, a gardener who must do his best to protect his plants from worms, wasps, and other kinds of bugs. If you leave your plant unattended, the insects will swarm all over it, eat the leaves and the plant will wilt, shrivel back and die. You have sprays, poisons, and swatters at your disposal, but the trick is to figure out which spray kills each insect outright, as the wrong spray will only stun them momentarily. Totally simple, totally addictive?what all good action games should be. Non-Spectrum owners now have a chance to experience the fun of another quirky Ultimate classic, thanks to John Dow and Retrospec. Two thumbs up!

Think you"ve seen every version of Tetris that exists? Well chances are you"ve never seen "Simpsons Tetris". Honestly, it"s pretty much the same as normal Tetris, except for the fact that you are competing against the computer to get the highest score, and that there are some Simpsons graphics in the game. If you like Tetris (and The Simpsons, but who doesn"t like The Simpsons?!) you might want to try this.

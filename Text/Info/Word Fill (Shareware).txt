Word Fill is basically a Fill-in-the-Word type puzzle program. In this puzzle a marked square playing grid is displayed on the screen along with a list of words. The object of the game is to place all the words on the list in the grid. These words can be in the vertical or horizontal direction. The program comes with a data file of approximately 1400 words that are used in creating the puzzle. The words are randomly chosen from the file. The user can also enter their own words (up to 60) into a playing grid. The program provides a number of special features. These include the ability to: save a puzzle to be completed later, change screen colors, print the puzzle or save it as an ASCII text file, and a Boss key to display a fake DOS screen. There are no special hardware requirements for the program. The game can be run off a single floppy disk and can be run in color or monochrome mode.

One of Angelsoft"s better releases, Forbidden Castle is a typical save-the-princess game set in a well-defined fantasy world that is brought to life by detailed descriptions.Puzzles are logical and fun, and some are even original. Most puzzles involve interactions with non-player characters, most of whom are well written and quite memorable.  One of my favorites is the mischievous Blue Faerie who would always do the opposite of what you ask her, so getting things you want require a fun exercise of pretending you don"t want  them. Angelsoft"s parser has been much improved from the days of Voodoo Island, and now understands some synonyms, although it is still not nearly as versatile as Infocom"s. Still, the wonderful descriptions and colorful characters make this worth a play-through for every IF fan.

An average 3D shooter. The graphics are wirefame and the 3D engine is very good. For example, you can destroy the ground (it shifts!). The game is mouse controlled. Controlling the space craft is quite easy and the movement is fluid. There are 4 levels and they are a bit repetitive, though not long. The presentation is also poor. Still, the game is challenging and the 3D engine is worth being checked. You might have problems with this game running too fast on modern PCs. I didn"t on mine, but I didn"t notice any delay routine in the code.

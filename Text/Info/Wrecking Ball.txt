Wrecking Ball has the player moving a paddle left and right in order to bounce a ball into bricks which disappear when hit. The goal is to clear the screen of bricks.  Controls are designed with early keyboards in mind; Caps-Lock and Insert are used for paddle movement.  These key settings cannot be changed, though the game does offer adjustable display settings and three different difficulty levels.

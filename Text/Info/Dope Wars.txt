The origin of the concept is John E. Dell\u2019s Drug Wars, written for a high school project in 1984. It is an economic simulation. You have some money borrowed from a loan shark. Within one month, you try to pay it back and make as much money as possible by selling drugs. There are several locations with different markets where you try to buy low and sell high, always in danger of being hunted by the police. You can buy a gun, but don\u2019t start out with one.

Within little more than a year, Drug Wars was remade by some programmers who called themselves the "Happy Hacker Foundation" as Dope Wars (Dope Wars was released in November 1985, but no copy of Drug Wars with the original time stamp seems to have survived). There is not much difference between the two games. Dope Wars mainly features a nicer interface, while still in character graphics, it uses more color. For some reasons, it was this name that stuck, possibly because "dope" sounded more harmless than "drug."

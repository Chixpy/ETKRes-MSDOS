As the game title implies, Al Unser, Jr. Arcade Racing is an action oriented racing game. While the game is set in the IndyCar racing league, not all 15 courses feature the trademark oval design; some of them are with curves and chicanes.

The game is designed for quick and easy experience, which means the only diversion from pushing the gas pedal is using the manual gear shifting - and this can be deactivated. There are overall three playing modes (plus multiplayer): practice, a championship with all 15 courses and a checkpoint race on any course.

It"s Zack"s first day on the job as a repairman at GadgetCo, and the whole factory is falling apart. He must navigate over 60 rooms, avoiding deadly traps, to find his missing tools and fix the incredibly complicated, interconnected machinery.

Contraption Zack is best described as a combination puzzle adventure and third-person isometric perspective version of The Incredible Machine.

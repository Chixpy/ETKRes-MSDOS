Cheesy Invaders is a clone combo of Space Invaders and Galaxian. Strange aliens are trying to attack earth and you have to stop them. You aim with your mouse and just shoot the aliens by clicking with your mouse. You fight against races known as The Planets, Mac and Cheese and TV adjusters. The game also features a short viewing high score and funny "game over" and "you lost a life" sound.

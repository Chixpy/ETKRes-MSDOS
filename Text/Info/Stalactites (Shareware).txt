Stalactites is a fairly unique action game that is somewhat hard to describe. It plays like the type of game you might find on the Atari 2600, and the author describes it as "A cross between Tempest and Break-Out". Erm, not really. But anyways it"s kinda neat, the object is to keep moving to prevent the "stalactites" (those are the ones that hang from the ceiling; stalaGmites come up from the Ground) from reaching the bottom of the screen while avoiding the "deadly bouncing balls". Simple old-school Atari 2600 type fun.

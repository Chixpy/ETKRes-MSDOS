From Barcelona, Spain comes one of the most advanced DOS mod players of the day. This mouse-driven, graphical player lets you "see" the music as well as hear it. The graphical interface features 4 oscilloscopes which show the 4 mod channels waveforms. The center of the screen shows file data info, 4 volume level indicators a full-spectrum oscilloscope, and a psychedelic lights panel that "moves" to the music. At the bottom of the screen are either two spectrum analyzers for stereo mode or one for mono mode, selectable in the options setup. All of the displays move in real time to the music simultaneously.

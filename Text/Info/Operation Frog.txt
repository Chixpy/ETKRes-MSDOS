Operation Frog is an educational title where players explore the inner body of a frog. You can choose between a male and female frog in the References section. There are two game modes: Dissect and Reconstruct. In Dissect mode, players have to cut open the frog"s body and remove its organs; and in Reconstruct mode, players have to put the already removed organs back to the frog"s body in the correct order. This game offers you scissors, a probe, a magnifying glass and tweezers - the necessary tools for your work. The scissors (not available in Reconstruct section) help you cut the frog"s body and remove organs, the probe gives you hints of where to cut (in Dissect section) or which part to place first (in Reconstruct section), the magnifying glass gives you information about each organ, and the tweezers help you move the organs. You don"t have to remove all the organs to see their information as you can look them up anytime at the Frog File Index section. You can also see the arrangement of the organs at the OptiFrog section. The game offers players a saving function.

This game, offered in Big Blue Disk #28, is a simple implementation of John Conway"s Game of Life, a mathematical diversion which simulates artificial life by applying a simple algorithm to an array of cells.  This particular version allows the user to manually or randomly create a pattern and then watch it evolve in real time or step-by-step using either the classic algorithm or what it calls the 3-4 variant.

If you"re hunting for an enjoyable word game, this could be it. While I have never played "Boggle", this game looks lot like it. The premise is simple: you have three minutes to shift the letters around in a 5x5 grid and create as many words as possible. Points are awarded and the high scores are recorded. The wordlist supposedly contains over 80,000 words. It would be a good idea to force players to look up words in the dictionary that they don"t know, because I sometimes spelled words by accident while moving around the tiles! :)

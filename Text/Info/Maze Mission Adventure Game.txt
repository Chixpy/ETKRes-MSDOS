The player here controls a secret agent, represented by an "X" in the middle of a textmode map window, searching a randomly-generated maze of indestructible and destructible blocks for three randomly-assigned objects of international espionage, to be gathered in sequence.

The player has a limited amount of moves, as measured in Oxygen, to navigate the (poison-gas-flooded) maze and locate the objects.  This is complicated by the roving of sensor drones, "x"s and "o"s, who zap the agent and return him to his starting location (a tendency that can be used strategically in times of low oxygen.)  The drones can be destroyed with a limited number of Ray-gun blasts, each of which clears the screen of enemies, while weak walls can be demolished through the use of limited supplies of TNT.  Finally, the player has a certain quantity of Hints that can be employed in order to indicate where in the larger maze the current section shown on screen is situated.  The player can also Teleport randomly around the level in search of his assigned objects, both through a limited personal supply and by finding telepads on the level.  Oxygen, TNT, Hints and Ray-gun blasts also can be topped up by finding their power-ups while wandering, as well as the Map Enlarger power-up that briefly increases the amount of the maze that is revealed at once.

The game will randomly generate six levels in total, each more unlikely to be survived than the last.

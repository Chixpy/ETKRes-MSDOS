Another adventure inspired by a classic comic book. Flash Gordon, after a failed attempt to divert a meteorite, he has to rescue his girlfriend from the clutches of the Emperor Dale. Gameplay is linear. The adventure was originally to be much easier with more chapters to come but only the first chapter, il Rapimento di Dale, was ever made.

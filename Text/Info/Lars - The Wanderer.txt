Lars: The Wanderer is an excellent fantasy "action RPG" from Gravity, a Korean developer.The game is similar to Sierra/Game Arts" Zeliard in gameplay and style, except there is more emphasis on the use of magic. The gameworld is diverse and vast: you will explore towns, caves, and mazes from the traditional 2D side-scrolling view. Along the way, you will talk to town citizens, buy more powerful weapons and spells to use, and battle hundreds of monsters. The effects of various spells in particular are very nice, especially since you can collect magic wands and "upgrade" them.

The game is in Korean, but by and large it is not difficult to figure out what to do, thanks to action-oriented gameplay. Lars" graphics are attractive, and the anime style should interest fans of console RPGs and platformers. Overall, definitely a charming and entertaining underdog that is well worth a look. Recommended!

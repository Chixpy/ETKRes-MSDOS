Oh, Boy, we"re in trouble now. The evil mad scientist Dr. Spoil Sport has decided that if he can"t have the world, nobody can. He has built a giant space station in orbit above the Earth, and threatened to blast the Earth with super laser beams if we don"t surrender.
            
Our only hope is for you to get to the space station and disable the weapons before the deadline. It would also be nice if you could get back to Earth alive so we can give you a big parade.

The evil scientist has set up space mines around the station. The only way to get up to the station is to use the teleport booth in Dr. Spoil Sport"s laboratory. You must get into his lab, past all the traps and robot guards, and find the teleport booth. Once you have reached the space station, you must find a way to disable the station"s weapons and then return to Earth. You have an electro-laser gun that may help you to blast some of the obstacles out of the way. Good luck.

A final warning: Some things, like getting shot or being  exposed to radiation, can cause damage to you. If you accumulate more than 100 damage points, you are dead. Try to avoid that.

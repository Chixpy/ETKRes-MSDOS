No Greater Glory puts you in the shoes of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis during the American Civil War. You make the great strategic, political, and economic decisions that will determine the fate of the American people for centuries to come. You will lead the government, mobilize the armies, pick the generals, and guide their movements. The epic struggle will ebb and flow - from Northern Virginia to Southern Louisiana, from St. Louis to Jacksonville, Florida. In the end, victory will come because of your strategic skills, your economic management, and your political acumen. No Greater Glory is an all-embracing simulation of national leadership during one of America"s greatest crisis.

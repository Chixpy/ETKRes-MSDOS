Air is a side-scroller from Taiwan developer Softstar. Despite what the name implies, the game actually takes place underwater most of the time. Different from most shooters from Softstar themselves, Air takes a decidedly "kid-friendly" approach by replacing baddies with cute-looking monsters like octopus, clams, and other deep sea denizens. You pilot a cute toy craft, complete with the huge winding mechanism in the back. 

Air was never officially released outside Asia.

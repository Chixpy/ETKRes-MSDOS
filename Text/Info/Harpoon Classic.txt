A naval battle simulator based on Larry Bond"s popular Harpoon board-game from 1980. In addition to the material found in the original game, this release adds Mediterranean and Indian Ocean battlesets as well as three designer series battlesets for each area and easy-to-use scenario editor. The informative database is updated from the original version, but gameplay itself is somewhat inferior as in-flight refueling and weapons reloads for ships are no longer possible. There are 48 new scenarios included in the CD-ROM. However, the newer version, Harpoon Classic "97, is also available and has everything added in this release as well as improved graphics.

A brief but notable foray into the board game market by the masters of interactive fiction,  Fooblitzsky is a novel attempt to use the PC to assist in playing a board game (e.g.roll a die) to make it more fun. Four players compete (as dogs-- no, really) to collect the right four objects before each other. A cool idea, but the awful 2-color graphics will convince you that this should be sold only as a *board* game-- and not only a good one at that.

Kim Sungshik"s first game after leaving Soft Action stays close to the programmer"s roots. The vertical scrolling shmup takes a similar approach to Box Ranger as a cutesy parody, even some of the enemy types are almost the same. It offers more variety, though, and for the first time in a Korean home entertainment shooter simultaneous 2-player gameplay.

Other than most later Danbi games, the game comes without a license, but that apparently had only positive effects on its quality. It"s still rather generic in the way it is played, and there are some technical issues, but the game is fun, nonetheless.

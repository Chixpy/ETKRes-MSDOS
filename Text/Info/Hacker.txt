Even today, Activision"s Hacker games remain two of the best espionage games ever made.The premise of Hacker 1 is novel: you accidentally stumble upon someone else"s computer system and can"t resist the temptation to hack it (the game even justifies its lack of instructions this way-- after all, no one will be there to help you if this actually happens). In Hacker 2, you are employed by the government after impressing them with your hacking skills earlier. Gameplay involves... nah, you"re on your own, remember? Rest assured these are great games though.

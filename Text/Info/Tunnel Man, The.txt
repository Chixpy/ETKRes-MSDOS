It seems like you"re caved in. Now you have to find your way out! TunnelMan is a story about a miner who experiences one of those bad days at work, in this case he has to find his way out of the mines.

In order to do so, he must find the emergency exit that will get him to the upper levels. But it seems that the emergency exit is wielded shut, if not humanly impossible to open with your bare hands. That means, you have to gather dynamites and the detonator available at each level to blow that emergency exit door to kingdom come!

Watch out, the ceiling looks fragile. It seems that everytime you walk pass a brick (ceiling), they fall down behind you. Basically means, one way only. 

This game requires some serious planning, so think ahead before you move. Because if you get stuck, your stuck. Game over - Restart.

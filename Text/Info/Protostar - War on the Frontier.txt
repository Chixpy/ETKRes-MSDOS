An alien race known as the Skeetch is threatening humanity and the peace in the entire galaxy. The human organization Newfront has launched a Protostar Initiative in an attempt to convince four alien races to join the humans in their battle against the Skeetch.

Protostar: War on the Frontier is a space trading/exploration game in the same mold as Starflight and Star Control series. The player can scour planet surfaces for resources, discover new planets and creatures and name them, use diplomacy, barter and trade with aliens, wage war against hostile races, find new crew members, and improve the financial situation of human organizations.

This release of SimCity 2000 includes the add-on SimCity 2000 Scenarios Vol. I: Great Disasters.

SimCity 2000 is the successor to the city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.

This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building "light" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.

Scenarios Volume 1: Great Disasters is an expansion pack for SimCity 2000. This particular addition adds a total of 10 harrowing scenarios which range from a fictitious UFO attack in Atlanta, Georgia - in Dec. 2050 no less - to the very real great Mississippi floods of 1993 (the Davenport flood in this particular instance).

This expansion was bundled with SimCity 2000 Bonus Cities and Scenarios and the SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit for Maxis" 1995 release of a special CD-ROM edition of SimCity 2000.

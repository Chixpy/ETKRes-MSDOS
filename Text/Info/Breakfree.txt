What do you get when you combine a Paddle game like Arkanoid and a 3D Shooter game like Doom? You get Breakfree, a 3D Paddle game where you "shoot" fireballs against walls similar to your average Paddle game but with a 1st Person Perspective approach.

The object of the game is to "break free", of which is done by destroying the (breakable) walls with the "balls" or in this case the fireballs you have. The fireballs will bounce back to you, of which you will bounce them back to the walls using your (invisible) paddle in front of you. Certain (red brick) walls, have bonuses that you have to "catch" after you destroy them with your fireball. When you lose all your fireballs, gameover.

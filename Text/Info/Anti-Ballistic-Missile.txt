Anti-Ballistic-Missile is a Missile Command variant. The object of the game is to protect six cities along the IBM east coast. The enemy has 12 missiles it will fire which need to be destroyed before they reach the cities. The player controls a cursor indicating where to fire anti-ballistic missiles. If the missile detonates within range of an enemy missile, the enemy missile is destroyed. If all of the cities are destroyed, the player loses the game; if any cities survive, the player wins (better scores are earned for more remaining cities). Several skill levels are available which control the speed of the enemy missiles and the accuracy required for destroying missiles.

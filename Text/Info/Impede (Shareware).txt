This is one of the simplest and most addictive games I"ve ever played. The rules are extremely simple: eat all of the dots before time runs out and don"t run into your tail. Unfortunately or rather fortunately it is easier said than done. As your tail grows from eating the dots it becomes increasingly more difficult to navigate the maze. As the levels progress it takes more time to think out a strategy to complete the levels. But don"t think too long you"ve only got 2 minutes.

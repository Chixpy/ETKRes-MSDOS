MythMaster is an EGA Sierra-style graphical adventure game in the style of the King"s Quest series of games. Here you play Anton, who is apparently on a quest to prove he"s not a "bumbler" by typing in simple commands like "OPEN DOOR" or "EAT PIE". There are many locations to explore in this game, and although they look nice most appear to be only for show and there"s not always a whole lot to do in the scenes. Also, even on "fast" walk speed your character seems to plod along far too slowly. Still, someone with patience and determination will likely enjoy exploring this world. (Note: See the included MM1GUIDE.TXT file for gameplay tips.)

Madspace is a first person action game in the Doom tradition. The quality of the 3D-engine is somewhere slightly above Duke3D. System Shock comes to mind here.  Tetratel offers a custom packaged version for their EyeFX glasses which should be identical to the full retail version. 
  
The name Madspace comes about since the laws of physics are often defied in this program. Maybe you know the kind of cartoon-joke where a dog enters his little dog-shack and inside we see a giant dog-palace with entrance hall, fireplace and the doors to the 40+ bath-rooms and kitchens. That"s the kind of weird space stuff with which Madspace tries to spice-up the aging genre.

The object of Pacman-like Wilf is to cover each of the levels/mazes with jam (dropped as you move around) and avoid the various enemies ("Glumphs"). Its CGA graphics combined with SoundBlaster sounds (a rarity at the time the game was programmed) add to the charm of this old game. I personally have fond memories of playing it many, many years ago, and seeing the text of the intro/registration screen ("trolley filled with cheesie biscuits") gave me nostalga pangs when I saw it. :) (Note: You will probably need to use DOSBox or MoSlo to play at normal speed.)

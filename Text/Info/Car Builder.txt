Educational game for children who want to learn about cars.

Car Builder is just what the title says, a car design game. You can modify anything from tires and suspension to engine type and body design of the car. When the car is finished you can test its aerodynamics in the wind tunnel and go to the test track to see how it handles curves, downhills etc.

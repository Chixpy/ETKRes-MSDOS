The dark lord Galuf has ambitions to take over the world, and there"s only one thing left that he needs: three magic seals, said to be the most powerful weapons in existence. When he comes to the castle where they are hidden, the princess entrusts them to a fairy to find help. She escapes the castle and finds three young travelers of improbable hair colors: Rare, Medium, and Well. The fairy entrusts each girl with one of the seals, and they set off to defeat Galuf, rescue the princess, and restore peace to the kingdom.

Totsugeki! Mix is a cute action platform game. Choosing one of the three girls, each with their own unique weapon, the player must travel through ten different stages fighting Galuf"s unreasonably cute army. There are several different special magic powers that can be collected, including a fairy familiar, magic shield, and time slow, and a boss waits at the end of each stage.

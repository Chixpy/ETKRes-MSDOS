This is a Super Mario Bros. clone with six levels, written in Turbo Pascal. I wrote this game to practice VGA programming. My goal was to create a PC game with parallax scrolling layers that would run smoothly on my 486 computer (25 MHz). I didn"t plan to release this Mario game, instead use the engine to make more original games.

However, an old beta version of this Mario game (with only four levels, unfinished) somehow ended up being spread around. I was very surprised to find someone selling disks with my Mario clone at a computer fair years later! I bought one to examine the contents at home. What I saw made me really furious: someone had actually changed the game into shareware, modified the executable, added some doc files and even a registration form, asking people to send $15!

Seeing other people make money from my games like this took away my motivation for games programming for a while. I kept finding this hacked version on shareware CD-ROMs and Internet sites.ly, I decided to release the complete source code of this game, so people can at least learn from it.

The game was originally written in Borland Turbo Pascal 6.0, which supports inline assembly. Because some people don"t have TP 6.0, I have also made a version of the source code for TP 5.5, which is available for free at Borland"s Museum.

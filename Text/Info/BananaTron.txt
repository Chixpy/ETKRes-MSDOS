Taking a tip from 1977"s Surround for the 2600 (and later, the 1982 movie Tron and its light-bike spin-offs -- but don"t ask me where the banana came in!) this is one of those games where you control an extending line on the screen, avoiding collision with your own trail or that of the other player(s).

No exciting changes are made to the time-tested formula: the conventional options include game speed, number of players (2-3) and whether the game screen has confining borders or wraps around.

A game about World Government, Politics, Control and Cause and Effect.

You start the game but being elected as the new US President, your tasks take place in many issues like resolving crisis, avoiding wars in conflict zones, sending aids (military, technology and social for example) and having a good approval rating by the US population.

This game is one of the unique politics games ever made.

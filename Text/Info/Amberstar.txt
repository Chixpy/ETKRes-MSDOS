Amberstar is a role-playing game which uses a top-down view for outdoor areas and switches to a first-person perspective when exploring cities and dungeons. Initially you are alone, but can make contact with other characters who will hopefully join your team. The fighting is turn-based and offers various defensive and offensive options, e.g. 90 different spells across 3 classes. Most of the time is spent doing smaller and bigger quests and leveling up the characters. The game features an auto-mapping and auto-saving system.

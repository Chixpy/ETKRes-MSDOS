This Mastertronic/Virgin version of Risk is an official conversion of the classic Parker Brothers board game.In contrast to many other "official" conversions that are poor replica of the board game originals, Risk is a competent conversion that features decent AI, many options, and intuitive user interface. As MobyGames explains it, the game offers ...two to six human and/or computer players attempt to conquer the world with their armies. Computer players have three different skill levels. 

There are actually four major versions of the game available: UK full game, US full game, UK short game, and US short game. The short games have an added rule to make the game go faster. In the UK short game, players can try to complete an assigned mission to win. In the US short game, players try to occupy enemy HQs. In addition to rule differences between the UK and US game, there are different graphics used for the cards." Overall, fans of the board game should find this computer version of Risk an excellent substitute for the real thing. Perfect for those nights when you can"t find enough people to play a game of global domination. Recommended!

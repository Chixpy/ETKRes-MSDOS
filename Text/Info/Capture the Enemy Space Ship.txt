Capture the Enemy Space Ship is a strategy game for one player. The players goal is to capture an enemy battle vessel without destroying it. The game takes place in an 8x8 grid; somewhere in the grid the enemy is hiding. To capture the enemy, all of the spaces around it need to be destroyed. On each turn the player can fire a phasor shot at one space in the grid which destroys it. The enemy moves every turn; while the last known position is known, its current location is unknown so there is a good chance the enemy will be destroyed if you aren"t careful. The player begins the game with 25 shots; occasionally the enemy will attack which drains energy causing a few shots to be lost. The game is lost if the enemy is accidentally destroyed or is still not captured when shots run out.

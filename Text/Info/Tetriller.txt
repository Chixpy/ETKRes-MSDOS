A guy has fallen asleep in front of monitor showing Tetris. You play the usual Tetris game filling a well with pipes, clocks, and other urban elements formed in tetris shapes. The twist is that guy mentioned above is walking at the bottom of the well. You have to make steps for him to climb to the exit of the well"s wall to free him. When he is freed, your structure will clear up and you begin to set him free again and again. It is a real nightmare for the guy because the falling elements can kill him or make him a prisoner if you are not successful.

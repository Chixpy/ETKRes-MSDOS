Do you want to play Space golf? --It sounds really amazing. If your answer is yes, probably this game is your only option which has a miniature shape in "zany" scenarios.

In each hole (a total of 18 hole courses) you try to give your best shots by just giving simple directions to the ball with your mouse. Since you are playing in space there is noair, no cruel wind conditions; just swing it to your "desired" destination!

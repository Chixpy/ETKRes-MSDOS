These are three text adventure games in the classic style.  No fancy graphics or sound effects.  Like a book, these games allow you to use your own imagination to create worlds of wonder that make graphic adventures pale in comparison.

Each of these three adventures is a distinct and separate game, each with it"s own complex solution.  They each have a magical theme.





Merlin"s Magic Forest             (FOREST.EXE)
----------------------------------------------

You have been magically transported back to ancient England, where the evil
sorceress Morgana has placed Merlin under a magic spell.  You must search the
magic forest for the ingredients which will lift the spell and release Merlin
from his death-like trance.  Danger, magic, and excitement await you when you
enter Merlin"s Magic Forest.

Merlin"s Golden Trove              (TROVE.EXE)
----------------------------------------------

As your reward for releasing him for Morgana"s evil spell, Merlin takes you
to his castle where a hoard of golden treasures awaits you.  But can you find
them all?  Some are well hidden, and some are guarded by trolls, gargoyles,
and other creatures you have only heard about.  It will be a true test to see
if you can discover all of Merlin"s Golden Trove.

Son of Ali Baba                   (ALIBABA.EXE)
-----------------------------------------------

This adventure takes you to old Baghdad, as you seek to thwart the evil
magician ROXOR and defeat his army of monsters.  See the giant Roc, the seven
headed serpent, and the living skeleton.  Ride the magic carpet, sail the
ship of Sindbad, and find the hidden cave of your father, Ali Baba. This
adventure will bring back those swashbuckling thrills you have longed for!

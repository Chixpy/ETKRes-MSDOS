War of the Mages is a configurable multi-player adventure game. The basic objective is to gain control over half of the cities in the game, at which point you will be declared the winner. Your most powerful tool in your quest for control is the Mage. Mages are magic-using creatures from another plane of existence. As such, they are immortal. Each player group is controlled by a Mage, and all relevant information about the status of each Mage is displayed along with the information for that group.

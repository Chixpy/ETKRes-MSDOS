"The time door will remain open for only ten hours, Doctor, so keep a watchful eye on the time."

"Remember, the survival of the world rests on this final attempt to find a reliable energy source. The Earth"s natural resources have been used up, and we have been unable to fully replace them. You must, by using this highly experimental process, travel through time into the Earth"s future, if there is one, and find out exactly how the future society has dealt with the problem. Do anything necessary to accomplish this. That may sound extreme and cruel, but think of it this way: there won"t be a future if the present doesn"t survive."

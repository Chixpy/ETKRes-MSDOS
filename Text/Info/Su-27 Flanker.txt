SU-27 is a deep, challenging and extremely accurate sim starring one of Russia"s premiere fighters in a variety of missions setted on Crimea (just below Ukraine). Disregarding graphics and presentation, the game puts the emphasis on a very solid flying model and the possibility to create your own missions or edit the existing ones using a simple yet powerful scenario creator.

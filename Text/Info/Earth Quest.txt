Part of the aborted Quest series, Earth Quest is not really a game but a very well-done reference program that packs an incredibly *huge* amount of information on a few 3.5" disks.It"s one of the early, well-written "encyclopedia" programs. The interface is intuitive (for those who knows Hypercard for the Macintosh, this is similar), and the quiz is quite difficult. This one is probably meant for adults or at least high-school students, because the font is small and the information is very detailed.

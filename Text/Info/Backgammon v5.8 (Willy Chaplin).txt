Backgammon is a program written entirely in 80X86 assembly language to run on IBM compatible computers. Using pattern recognition techniques developed to guide "smart" weapons similar to those use in the recent Gulf War, Backgammon plays the game entirely without rules other than those specific to the play of the game. That is, it has no rules of thumb for deciding which of the many possible moves it will make at each turn.

Peter Pan & Robin Hood Fairy Tale Factory is yet another lackluster offering in Hi-Tech"s line of entertainment titles for kids.The idea of the program is simple: kids can choose characters from Peter Pan or Robin Hood, put them in a setting of their choice, then add speech or write the story, which can then be saved or printed out. The selection of characters is quite small, and there is little variation in each character"s gesture to leave room for creativity. There is only one picture of tinker bells, for example, who faces the right side, which means she"ll have to be placed on the left side of the screen in every scene. Pretty dumb, if you ask me. There is really no reason to use this program unless you want to create a quick scene from these two stories. I doubt the program will appeal to anyone, and the kids in your family will probably get bored before long.

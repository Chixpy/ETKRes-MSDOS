Graphic role playing games like DUNGEON OF DEATH combine elements of both arcade-style games and text adventures.  Like an arcader, the game"s playing screen displays the walls of the maze-like dungeon, the treasures, and your character.  As in text adventures, printed messages describe the world of the adventure; typed commands move you through the dungeon. 

As you move, monsters attack without warning, forcing you to choose between fighting or running away.  How well you pick your battles is the key to the game.

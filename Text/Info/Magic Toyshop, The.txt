A one-room puzzle feast. No plot to speak of, a modicum of atmosphere, one interesting character: Catharine, the toyshop"s owner"s daughter. She plays nine games with you, some traditional, some based on puzzles from other adventure games, a few requiring bending of the rules. Contains references to Trinity and Curses!, but the only puzzle that requires knowledge of either is optional. The final puzzle is very hard unless you"re familiar with the works of Raymond Smullyan. Has an in-plot hint system (ask Catharine for help). Contains good examples of how to include board games in a text adventure.

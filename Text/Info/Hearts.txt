Hearts is an "evasion-type" trick-taking playing card game for four players, although variations can accommodate 3\u20136 players. The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria,[1][2] though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game.

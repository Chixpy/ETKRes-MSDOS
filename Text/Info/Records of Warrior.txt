Records of Warrior is a decent solitaire mahjongg game from prolific Taiwan developer Softworld.The game is a typical match-the-tiles game that many Western gamers recognize from Activision"s superb Shanghai series, with a neat twist: set in a fantasy land, you have to travel from one province to another, beating various mahjongg games as you go. Each game has a time limit, which gets shorter the further you progress, thereby gradually increasing the difficulty. You can also use "magic," a special item that helps you out in tight spots. Other than these two "new" features, Records of Warrior is quite an average mahjongg game that lacks many options that are common in today"s mahjongg games. Pleasant graphics and plot (if you can read Chinese, that is) nonetheless make this worth a look for mahjongg players. Decent, but far from meriting our Top Dog tag.

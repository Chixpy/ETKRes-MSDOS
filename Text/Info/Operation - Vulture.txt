"In the Middle East, a group of nations is attacking a U.S. stronghold in Saudia Arabia, where a top secret U.S. project is underway, called ""Operation: Vulture."" This project is creating the prototype AH-7A Vulture, the largest attack chopper in history. It holds six 2000 lb. bombs, conventionally used only on jet aircraft, and 1000 rounds of explosive ammo. This aircraft capable of storing all this armament, is forty feet long, and weighs fifty thousand pounds. Due to this, the rotor must spin so fast that it cannot be seen, even with high tech camera equipment. It goes 500 M.P.H., and can produce G forces capable of ripping your head off.

This helicopter has never been tested, (It never got off the ground.) so a very capable pilot must be selected. You are one of the four most capable pilots that are judged to be good enough to fly this completely experimental monstrosity.

U.S. forces will be able to reach this location in three weeks, but radar reports enemy aircraft traveling this direction already. Your mission is to use the top secret AH-7A Vulture in a defensive attack against enemy air and ground forces, and clear the way for U.S. forces to drive back the attacking forces. During your attempt, try to destroy any enemy forces you can. Your country is counting on you to succeed."

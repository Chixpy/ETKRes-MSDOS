"Shoot all the Invaders while hiding behind the bunkers to help protect you. You have a total of four laser cannons (""lives"").

Each time you shoot all the Invaders in a given attack wave, a fresh attack wave will appear.

Each new wave features slightly faster Invaders, and they start a little closer to your planet each time.

If any aliens touch down on your planet, you have been INVADED, and you lose the game at that point.

Saucers appear from time to time and can have VERY high score values, depending on your skill in shooting them. Remember how the original game did it? :) Just don"t get too distracted shooting at the Saucers...

Some higher attack waves will bombard your planet"s visual sensors and make it difficult for you to see the Invaders. Be careful!"

In 2007 the author made this game freeware (was previously shareware).

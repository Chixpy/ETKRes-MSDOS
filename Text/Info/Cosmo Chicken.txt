Remember that "Astro Chicken" mini game in Sierra"s Space Quest 3? Cosmo Chicken is a lot like that ... it even uses extremely similar graphics. If you"ve never played Space Quest 3, Cosmo Chicken is similar to Lunar Lander. The object is to carefully land your chicken on the landing pad, watching out for dogs, etc. A well made fun game but not likely one you"d play for very long. (NOTE TO ALL! No, I cannot legally add Space Quest or any other Sierra games to this site, since they are still copyrighted by Sierra. Sorry!)

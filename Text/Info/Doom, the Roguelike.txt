This game is a mix between two classic games: Rogue, the text-only dungeon crawl role-playing game that has spawned a whole genre of games, and Doom, one of the breakthrough games for 1st-person shooter genre.

The story is the same as in Doom: You are some soldier performing his monotonic duties in a space base on Phobos -- when suddenly your base is attacked. The only way out is through. Equipped only with a pistol, you start to shoot your way through the mazes.

The whole game is text-only, but made in a Doom-like style (the sound effects in the Windows version are the original Doom sounds). The only difference to Doom is that you haven"t got a realistic 3D world. What you"ve got are simple 2D text graphics, like in Rogue, where @ denotes the player character, letters denote monsters and other characters denote items.

Apart from the style, this game is a straight Rogue-like dungeon crawler. The gameplay is turn-based, with each action taking a certain amount of time. As in a role-playing game, the character has different stats that increase with his experience -- he can reload faster, do more damage, shoot more accurately etc. During the game, you find different weapons and power-ups, all well-known to doom players (blue sphere power-ups, green armor etc.).

The game is freeware and was written in FreePascal, using the Valkyrie library by the same developer.

Object of the game is to move around the screen completing three sides of a box and not being hit be the meanies. If you complete it the box will fill and you are ready to start again. The cursor keys control direction.

Idea borrowed from a pass arcade favorite of mine called Quixx. I don"t see it anywhere.

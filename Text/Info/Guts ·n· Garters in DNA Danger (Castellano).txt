The world is in danger again as general Wort has some evil plans with it. Elite soldiers Hank "Guts" Carter and Stacy "Garters" Pringle are sent in to stop him and his minions.

Played in a style similar to Cabal, the game has you controlling Guts or Garters by keyboard and mouse. Each level consists of multiple connected static screens (including a boss-confrontation screen) that must be cleared.

Storming soldiers, helicopters, and tanks must be shot, but do not forget to reload your weapon and search for ammo. Once a scene is cleared, search and collect hidden items. Exits by way of arrows then become visible granting you access to the next screen.

Indiana Jones is an archaeologist and adventurer, searching the globe for hidden treasures and lost artifacts. Towards this end, Indiana Jones has arrived in Mexico during the 1930s. Although the people living in the town of Lucasio are friendly, others such as Nazis, desperados and dangerous creatures are not so much. Indiana must use his skills to accomplish his objectives and retrieve treasured objects.

Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is an action/adventure game, seen in top-down view. Players control Indiana Jones as he collects items, attempts to solve all the puzzles and defeat his enemies in order to complete the mission. Indiana primarily uses his whip, but may also pick up a pistol or other weapons to use against foes. Indiana has a health meter on screen and will die if it drops to zero.

The design of the game is meant to be casual gaming and is simplified to give the player quick experiences. Upon beginning a game, the player chooses the size of the game world (and indirectly the length of time it will take to complete). The game world, all the characters, items, and Indiana"s mission are then randomly generated. Individual locations, such as the town of Lucasio may remain the same, however the path to and from those areas may change considerably.

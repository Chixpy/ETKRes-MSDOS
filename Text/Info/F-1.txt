"F-1" is an unofficial Formula 1 racing game. You must compete along the Formula 1 season (16 circuits included). There are three game modes: Practise, Race (Single race) & Complete season.  Before each race, you can modify aspects like tires, transmission (manual or automatic), the number of laps or the difficulty level (between three levels).

During the race, if you have problems, you have the option to stop at the boxes to repair your car.

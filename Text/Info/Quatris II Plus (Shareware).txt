"You are given objects composed of 2 or more blocks which will start falling down from the top of the screen. You can rotate and move these blocks by pressing up, left, right, and down arrow cursor keys.

You are to rotate and guide these objects to the bottom of the well in a way so that they will all ""fit"" together. When you completely fill up a row, that particular row will disappear. You are to continue this step so that the objects will not stack-up to the top--if they do, the ""GAME IS OVER"". If this is your first time playing, do not use any of the bombs, it will give you a wrong idea of the game. Also note that there are several penalties for using the bombs.

The more rows you fill-in at once, the more points or more (QX)s you get. High scores are sorted using your (QX)s.

You can use Regular, Super, or Match bomb by pressing ""1"", ""2"", or ""3,"" repectively. Again, if you are a first time player, using the bombs at this point can give you a wrong idea of how this game works.

Quatris II+ is a tournament style game that can take hours to complete. For the player"s convenience, Quatris II+ lets the player save the game and continue at a later time. To save the game, simply press [ESC] and your game will be saved using your NAME as the file name with "".SAV"" extension in the Quatris II+ directory. This is the same file where your keyboard configuration is also stored."

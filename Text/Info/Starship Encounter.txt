You are the lone astronaut on a long-range deep-space probe of the Horse Head Nebula. Your small ship is suddenly overtaken by a gigantic alien spacecraft.  Before you can escape, you are seized by a tractor beam and pulled aboard their ship.

The aliens immediately blast your ship apart and drag you from the wreckage.  Although you fight valiantly, you are overpowered and taken to a room.  Strapped to a table, a helmet-like object is placed upon your head. Instantly you feel a searing pain.  In between bouts of agony you realize the aliens are probing your mind for information about Earth.

You are able to learn a little about the aliens during the mind link. Although humanoid in appearance, they are deaf-mute and cannot make any sounds at all.  Extremely hostile, the aliens" mission is to locate and destroy all other civilizations they encounter.  Now that Earth"s location is known, they will proceed there immediately and execute their orders.

Once the aliens finish probing your mind, they drag you off to a cell. After a little while, an alien comes to the door of your cell with a tray of food from your ship.  He presses a button on an electronic device, which emits a whistling noise.  The door of the cell opens and he deposits the tray inside.  He then presses the button again, it emits another whistling noise, and the cell door closes.

As you sit there alone, you realize that you must escape from your cell, find a way to destroy or disable the alien base ship, and return to Earth to warn of the impending danger.  It would also be nice if you could find the plans to this ship, so that Earth can eventually build some like it to defend itself.  You know that you must hurry, for it will only be a few hours before this base ship reaches Earth and destroys it.

Columns PC is an addicting Tetris-Style (tm Spectrum Holobyte) shareware game in which columns of jewels fall from the top of the screen. It is your mission to line up matching groups of 3 or more jewels together either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When this is accomplished, matching jewels will disappear. The game ends when the pile of objects reaches the top of the screen.

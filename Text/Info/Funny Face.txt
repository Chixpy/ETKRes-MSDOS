A children"s game wherein kids could make their own drawings by butting several parts of a face together. You could choose from a high amount of noses, mouths, ears and eyes, as well some haircuts. 

In version 2 there are double as much tiles to make faces off, as well an option to color (though this is made pretty bad, you could color the game-interface away) and support for some more printers (now we know why we love windows again)

You could also export your pictures to a .pcx file.

If you enjoy old-school ASCII games (that is, games that use default character-set "graphics") you"ll probably find ANSiDude pretty cool. It"s kind of like the classic Kroz series, except with more story elements and an inventory system. The graphics are decent (for a text mode game!). Overall the game is not extremely fun to play, but definitely worth a look for those interested in this type of game.

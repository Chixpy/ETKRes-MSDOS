This is where UFO - A solar system odyssey"s fun begins. Find out which planet it is that the UFO is heading to. Refer to the data bank if you do not know it or get more hints and spend some fuel with the landing capsule to explore the place where you last saw the UFO. Other hints can be such as "it is near a reddish, gaseous planet" or "at the fifth planet from the sun"...

Mission UFO is an educational game for kids to learn facts about our solar system but it still is some fun for the older people who are interested in some interesting facts about the planets and space missions. As I already told you it is your task to find the UFO that comes exploring our solar system. You hunt it from planet to planet, always getting new hints on the current location from mission control. Mind that you don"t run out of fuel and guess the planets to travel correctly. Finally you meet the UFO and the alien life form in charge for that UFO. He/she/it tells you a few facts from where he/she/it came and you are being promoted by the head of mission control and the UFO Division director from NASA.

The graphics are nothing special but nice and the gameplay is fun! The sound mainly consists of some beeps and buzzes and the famous countdown (5 -4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - lift off) as real speech. The controls are just clicking with the mouse on the buttons on screen. Click on "radio" for hints, "nav chart" to choose your destination and "data bank" for information on our solar system. When you need some more hints use the hovercraft to reach the hint buttons on the planets surface. When you run out of fuel return to earth. That"s it.

Even though this game is soooo simple I recommend it to everyone who cannot tell the planets order and to those who don"t know how our planets look like. And, of course, I recommend it for all children who want to become astronauts! Give it a try and do not expect this to be a game like Elite or Wing Commander. This is just an educational quiz game but worth 4 points!

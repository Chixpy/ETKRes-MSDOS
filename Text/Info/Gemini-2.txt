Your remote controlled Gemini tank is a powerful weapon. Battle enemies on remote planets and try to kill three of their tanks before they destroy yours. Drive your tank with the arrow keys and shoot with the space bar. Check your targeting maps and charts on the bottom of the screen to home in on your enemy and blast them to bits. Remember to keep an eye on your damage meter because otherwise it"ll be your bits that"s blasted. 

Gemini-2 is a sequel to Gemini but is very similar to the original game. Identical to the first game with a Telegamming mode which allows you to take on human opponents across phone lines while the new practice mode allows you to take on computer controlled enemies to get warmed up.

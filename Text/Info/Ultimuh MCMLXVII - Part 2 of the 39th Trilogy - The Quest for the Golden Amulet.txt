Satirical video games are generally more effective if they look and play anything remotely like their inspiration (Untima a better example in this case), but that hasn"t kept a couple of teens from throwing together a side-scrolling homage to the wispy plots, repetitive gameplay and spotty use of Olde Tyme Englishe diction strewn throughout the Ultima series (also initially, it should be noted, the handiwork of a couple of teens.)

You play a wizard, advancing step-by-step ever to the right side of the screen across the harsh wilderness landscape of what amounts to a Grade 2 student"s first attempt at using MS Paint.  Enormous, static, intentionally-crudely-rendered monsters block your path, but they are easily dispatched by close use of the "<tt>A</tt>" key, to attack.  Various statistics are kept track of, incrementing and decrementing as you move, fight and kill, replenished by giant magical potions dotting the landscape.  At the end of each level is a huge golden amulet -- alas, decoys all of them.  Every subsequent level plays identically to the prior, save that the monsters require an additional hit to do away with.

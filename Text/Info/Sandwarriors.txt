This is an arcade sci/fi flight game similar in style to "Inca" series, but with an ancient Egyptian setting (like Stargate). The story goes as such, in the year 6225 B.C. on the far flung, sand covered planet of Tawy, a high-tech civil war is taking place. Over many generations two opposing Houses have formed, House Horus and the evil House Set, both completely determined to annihilate the other. As an elite warrior of the Horus empire, you are commanded by God Horus to pilot the Sandships of the gods to destroy your evil enemies or die trying!

Anyone who watches TV often, which would include just about everyone in the world except Amish people, has seen Bob Saget. Most know him as the host of "America"s Funniest Home Videos". Other people might recognize him as one of those idiots from "Full House". Maybe you know him from somewhere else.

Bob tells the worst, most annoying jokes in the world, and the effect is only enhanced by that dopey smile he always sports. He might not write the jokes, but there"s no disputing the fact that he tells them. Plus, all the shows he appears on are absolutely horrible. Anyways, it"s hard not to hate Bob Saget, so we thought if we made a game where you killed him, someone out there might enjoy it.

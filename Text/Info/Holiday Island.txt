Holiday Island is in the style of Sim City, but instead of building a town you have to fill up some Carribean Isles to create the ideal holiday location. There are more than 60 different buildings to choose from - hotels, bars, car rentals, sport facilities, parks, discos and many more. You are facing several rivals, and can play dirty tricks on them to inhibit their progress

You can start an endless game or play one of the 6 scenarios, each with a different goal. The backing MIDI music is Carribean-themed - Reggae and samba.

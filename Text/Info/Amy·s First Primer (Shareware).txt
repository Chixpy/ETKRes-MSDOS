"Programs for young children are hard to find. They must be extremely simple to use, very colorful and attractive, and they need to be fun and free of negative rewards. Our own five year old Amy wouldn"t spend five minutes with the programs her older brothers enjoyed. She didn"t like the idea of destroying things or being destroyed. In addition to being frustrated with the family computer, Amy"s birthday came on September 8, forcing her to wait almost a year longer than some of her friends before going to kindergarten.

Amy"s First Primer was written by her father and brothers to help her work on the things her kindergarten friends were doing. After much testing and reprogramming, the programs finally met Amy"s full approval. We think your child will approve, too."

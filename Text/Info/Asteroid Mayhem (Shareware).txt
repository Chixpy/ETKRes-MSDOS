"Long long ago, in a star system far far away, there was a great war. Back in those days, space travel was still limited to sub-light speeds, and deflector technology was extremely limited, and therefore asteroid fields tended to be an extreme nuisance.

To deal with this problem, it became quite common for ship captains to order their fighter pilots to clear paths for them. Now that the war is over, and technology has improved, these things are but a distant memory. Or are they? As it turns out, this whole thing has developed into an extremely popular form of entertainment in which pilots test their skills by locking themselves into a duel with rocks as large as 40 meters in diameter.

Do you have what it takes to pilot a fighter, blow up rocks, and avoid being brutally annihilated by simulated alien creatures?"

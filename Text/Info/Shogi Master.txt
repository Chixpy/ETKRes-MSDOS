Shogi is a Japanese variant of chess where you can return your opponent"s captured pieces to the game, but on your side instead! There are many other rule differences (and unique pieces) in this fantastic strategic game that I like better than standard Chess.Shogi has been very popular in Japan for centuries. Shogi Master recreates the game superbly with a tough computer opponent. This product was only available by mail order but now you may download and enjoy it!

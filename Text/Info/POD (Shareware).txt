Move your pod around the network of coloured tracks to remove them but avoid falling off or being left stranded. Different colours require multiple passes which makes life that more interesting and other pieces do even more interesting things like throwing you half way across the board! Using the cursor keys the game is easy to play yet the levels can be very challenging for even the most dedicated puzzle freaks. Children will find the colours amusing and the simplicity of the game will enable them to play it almost immediately. The game comes with online help sound effects and a demo mode which goes through the basics of the game while you watch. 20 levels are issued with the shareware version while registered users will enjoy a further 60 levels plus a utility that enables them to create their own POD levels. POD works on any IBM compatible with EGA graphics and 256KB of memory.

Archon Ultra is a complete remake of classic cross-platform action/strategy smash Archon. 

The game features completely rewritten code with better game engine, much-improved graphics and sound as well as digital music (a la MOD files), along with a new style of game board and an additional "special weapon" for each figure. It also adds multiplayer game (modem as well as hot seat).

Interstel"s first and --thankfully-- last RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world that predates Interplay"s classic Wasteland by a few years, Scavengers of the Mutant World unfortunately doesn"t play as good as it looks, with an extremely out-of-balance character development that makes combat very frustrating most of the time.Good for some nostalgic and curiosity-quenching moments, and at least it"s highly replayable because the map is randomly generated every time you start a new game.

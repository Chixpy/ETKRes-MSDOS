"Turbo Texas Hold"Em is designed to help you save money and make money playing poker.

The essence of poker is decision-making. We are confronted with one situation after another and must choose from among several alternative courses of action.

The essence of decision-making is experience. You probably would not board an airplane if you knew the pilot had never flown before, even if he or she had read all the books. You would certainly feel better if you knew he or she had flown at least some and had spent numerous hours in a flight simulator learning to make correct decisions in critical situations.

Turbo Texas Hold"Em is your flight simulator.

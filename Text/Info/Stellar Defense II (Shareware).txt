You are a Laragian Star Fighter. Your objective is to make sure that supply lines between friendly starbases are kept clear of asteroid belts and the evil Yarian Starships. There are 4 Starbases (See Starbases Section) to each Galaxy which must be secured (or we are all doomed!). There are a total of 5 Galaxies (only the first is in the SHAREWARE VERSION) which must be liberated from the Yarian Invasion Force. At the end of each Galaxy, you will face the Yarian 2nd Class Mother Ship for one last battle to decide the fate of that Galaxy. The 5th and FINAL Galaxy is the Yarian Homeworld, where the ULTIMATE MOTHER SHIP (talk about the MOTHER OF ALL SHIPS!) Commanded by Lord Yarian himself is to be destroyed. GOOD LUCK!!!

Iron Seed is a game of strategy in which you must develop the strength and knowledge necessary to unite the free worlds, and defeat the alien horde that threatens the galaxy. You begin with a single ship, and a chosen crew. Research, exploration, and diplomacy, are essential elements for success. New Ships, new upgrades, and ancient artifacts will help you in your efforts. Combat will be both randomly thrust upon you, and planned for in your grand strategy.

The object of Codebreaker is to guess a sequence of four colored pegs in ten tries or less, with only the cryptic feedback of white and black \u201ckey pegs\u201d to guide you. This text-mode version of Mastermind is nicely done, with a complete on-line help system. There are even a few additional features, such as the timer and ten-color play, that were not in the original board game.

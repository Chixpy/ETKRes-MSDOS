Three distinct characters are on offer in this shoot "em up - choose from Kamchak the lizard or humans Dan and Eleena. The game"s path varies depending on which character you choose. 

The planet Ioxia is vital to your society, as nowhere else provides the vital element Mazrium. However, its long dormant alien forces have been woken up, and must be destroyed by a one-man army. You must fly into the Citadel to destroy its power source.

Eradicator combines pure action and puzzle solving, with 1st-person and 3rd-person views to switch between. There are 20 different weapons, with the missiles you control after launching perhaps the most unusual. The single-player levels plus five more are all available for multi-player action.

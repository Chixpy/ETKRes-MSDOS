"BATTLE HAS SPREAD OUT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBOR BASE. IT"S UP TO YOU TO SETTLE EVERYTHING UP... THE HARD WAY.

THE SCENERY OF THE GAME IS SET UP IN AN EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT OF MOUNTAINS AND PLANES. THE TWO BASES ARE AT EACH CORNER PLANNING THEIR ATTACKS. THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO ANNIHILATE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE ENEMY LIVING AT THE ENEMY BASE. THE WINNER IS DECIDED WHEN NOBODY REMAINS IN ONE OF THE BASES DECLARING THE OTHER PLAYER THE WINNER.

PLAYER ONE IS THE BLUE BASE LOCATED AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. PLAYER TWO IS THE RED BASE LOCATED AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN.

CHOOSE YOUR ANGLE AT THE PLAYER SCREEN USING THE CURSOR KEYS, LEFT WILL MOVE YOUR ANGLE TOWARD THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT CURSOR KEY WILL MOVE YOUR ANGLE TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE.

CHOOSE THE POWER NEEDED TO FIRE THE MISSILE USING THE UP AND DOWN CURSOR KEYS. UP INCREASES THE POWER AND DOWN DECREASES THE POWER. NOTE THAT EVERY TIME YOU GET A DIRECT HIT, YOUR MAXIMUM POWER DECREASES AND YOUR BASE GET UNDER REPAIRS FOR A FEW ROUNDS UNTIL EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL. IT USUALLY FIXES ITSELF AROUND 5 PERCENT PER ROUND."

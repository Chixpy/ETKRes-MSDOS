Strike Squad is a squad-based tactical strategy game, much like the later X-Com from Microprose. Strike Squad is the sequel to Mindcraft"s Tegel"s Mercenaries.

The Consortum is falling prey to an alien race of insects, called K"Kistiks, that move from planet to planet and dry their resources. One last planet, Berok, remains for the Consortum resistence, and its distress beacons have been dispatched to call for aid, in the attempt to gather mercenaries from around the universe toward their cause. Your character in the game, in turn, is a successful mercenary commander, that is after personnal revenge against the K"Kistiks, for having destroyed your home planet Bao and killed your loved ones. 

Choose your mercenaries, that rate very differently in a variety of skills (from shooting to medical), and battle your enemies in either real-time or turn-based.

The game features some management elements also, and you get to purchase weapons and tools from dealers.

Also, the game features a 2-player, split-screen mode, and the players can either play as allies or enemies.

Definitely the best gangster game I"ve ever played and one of the best shareware games ever, Crime Fighter is a game for up to 4 players where the objective is to commit as many crimes as possible to seize control of the underworld.Depending on the type of building you enter, you can raid the stores, steal cars, kidnap children, raid banks, attack mail trains, etc. As you gain in notoriety you can recruit gangsters and equip them with guns for bigger schemes. Extremely addictive and thoroughly engaging, this game is a must play for all strategy fans. Formerly shareware, the author Peter Steffen has released the game as freeware in 2001, so there is no longer any excuse not to try out this excellent underdog. Two thumbs up, and a venerable entry into our Hall of Belated Fame.

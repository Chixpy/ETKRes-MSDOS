A scurillous mix of Lemmings and Tetris. Whenever you clear a row, a Lemming falls down. Depending on the chosen gamel\u00b4play mode, you are supposed to either kill them or keep them alive.

Jan Cajti Zeithaml originally wrote Lemris in 1994 in Turbo Pascal 6.0. Lemris 2 is re-coded in Borland C++ and has some extra features like background music and an animated title screen. The version you can download here was compiled in 2000, the last one released by the author.

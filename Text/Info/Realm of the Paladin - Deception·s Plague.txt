Completely forgotten nowadays RPG set in the fantasy-medieval world, and the main character has to kill the main villain (unfortunately, the plot of the game is very arbitrary and not very important for the story.) Feature of the game world is large enough that we can study and in which there is a sufficient number of NPC to communicate with them (though for the most part - quite useless). Fighting is, but they received less attention. After the game very much criticized for its graphic design, and this can partly agree: an isometric perspective view, but the building (which, by the way, you can sign), objects, and features characters drawn very blurry so sometimes really do not understand that appeared before our eyes. However, from the big fans of the old RPG game noteworthy because at least its collectible value is very high.

For those not familiar with the game, this is essentially the same as that old school time favorite, HANGMAN. The goal of the game is to guess a phrase which is depicted by blanks for each character in the phrase. The phrase description is presented under the puzzle for a hint. The contestant of PLAYER must 1) spin the wheel to guess a consonant, 2) Buy a vowel for $250, or 3) Guess the puzzle. When you spin the wheel and correctly identify a consonant in the puzzle, your score is increased by the value on the wheel times the number of times that consonant appears in the puzzle phrase, and your turn continues. If the consonant does not appear, or you guess a letter which has already been used, the play continues with the next contestant.

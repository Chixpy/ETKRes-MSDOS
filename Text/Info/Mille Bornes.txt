Mille Bornes (which means "a thousand milestones" in French) is an excellent PC game based on a popular French card game of the same name.Brief rules from CentralConnector.com: "Mille Bornes is a card game for 2, 3, 4 or 6 players, usually played as a partnership game by 4 players - 2 on each team. As a driver, you must follow the rules of the road. Namely: You can go only when the light is green. You must stop when the light is red. You must obey speed limit signs. If you get a flat tire, you must use a spare. If you run out of gas, you must refill your tank. If you have an accident, you must repair your car. 

In this card game, you must follow these very same rules. And while sticking to them, you and your partner must try to travel 1,000 miles along an imaginary road. But be careful! Your opponents are trying to do the same and will try to slow you down by placing hazards in your path. Your challenge: to accumulate mileage by overcoming these hazards, while also trying to slow your opponents" progress with hazards of your own. The final object of the game is to be the first team to accumulate a total of 5,000 points in several hands of play. In doing so, you must try to complete a trip of exactly 1,000 miles in each hand played." 

This freeware version (actually advertised as shareware, but the registered version is identical to the freely-distributable one) is a very good electronic version of this little-known card game, sporting a very nice mouse-driven interface, challenging AI, and plenty of options. If you like card games in general, especially games like Uno, this now out-of-print underdog will definitely prove a delight. Two thumbs up, way up!

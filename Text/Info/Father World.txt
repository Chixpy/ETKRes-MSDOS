Father World is an action game with adventure elements. Peace in a megalopolis is threatened by a mysterious demon and his cyborg minions. A lone hero agrees to do what the authorities can"t: single-handedly avert the threat. The game is very similar to Another World visually, though it contains by far less platforming elements and setpieces, and focuses on exploration, making it feel more like an adventure game. The player navigates the protagonist through side-view environments, talking to characters, obtaining quests, and occasionally engaging in combat and avoiding obstacles. Character animation is almost identical to that of Another World; the hero is able to run, jump, perform a running jump, and crouch.

Steel Panthers III is the third in the Steel Panther series, which chronicles the exploits of tanks from a top-down hex-based setting. 

This time, SSI changed the scale slightly to allow larger battlefields and unit command structures, with improved leaders and command interface. Otherwise, this game isn"t much changed from Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles.

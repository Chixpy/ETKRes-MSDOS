Kent lives in the police state of Neutropolis where everyone and everything is supposed to be normal.  But Kent doesn"t want to be normal.

In this 1st-person 3D animated graphic adventure (ala Tex Murphy, but more cartoony), you must elude the police and solve puzzles as you travel through the many locations.

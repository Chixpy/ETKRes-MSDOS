As in ages past, the shadow of a great evil falls across your homeland. In a trial that marks the passing of an age, a champion must once again take up the legendary Thor"s Hammer to quell the encroaching darkness.

Thor"s Hammer consists of three episodes: The Trial, The Journey and The Battle. The game has a medieval background and so are the weapons and items you find: axes, spells and armor. The game plays like a first person shooter with very light RPG elements; you have for example to interact with NPCs to gather information and get advice from them. Each episode consists of one large level with an automap feature.

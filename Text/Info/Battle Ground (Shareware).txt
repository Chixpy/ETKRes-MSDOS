"Battle Ground is a two-player tactical ground combat game typical of the mid 20th century. Employing various types of soldiers, weapons, and terrains, the object of the game is to defeat your opponent by destroying his platoon of soldiers. Each weapon available to both sides (United States and Germany) has its strengths and weaknesses, as does each type of soldier. For example, some weapons have a more limited range than others, and soldiers vary in strength and effectiveness in combat. In addition to a main weapon, each soldier carries hand grenades, which can be thrown only as far as the soldier"s strength permits. A player may also call an air strike at some points in the game, and artillery strikes are also permitted.

In the beginning of the game the US platoon occupies a portion of the battlefield, while the German platoon occupies another portion. The initial placement of the respective sides will differ with different terrains. Both players must devise and execute a battle plan to be successful."

Computers came into our life about the same time as our first child, Amanda.  Eighteen months later Zakary was born.  As they grew they noticed daddy spending nearly every day working with a computer and they wanted to use the computer like daddy did.  So, I went through the software stores and saw all kinds of wonderful gamesand educational software - but nothing for very young children.

What I wanted was something that would let an 18 month old bang on the keyboard and be entertained.  As he grew older, and his coordination improved, the software should teach him about letters, numbers, colors, shapes using the keyboard and multiple key combinations.  Since I couldn"t find anything I wrote Play "n Learn.

Play "N" Learn provides several different games  and there are multiple games that can be played within each main game. For example, with Amanda"s Letter Lotto young toddlers can push keys that change colors and symbols on the screen and get sounds from the computer.  As your kids grow older they progress to locating specific keys and learning multiple key combinations.  At the most difficult level of play you need to correctly pick five secret letters to win Letter Lotto.  It works just like a miniature version of the Lotto games run by many states.

In these instructions we"ll describe the different games and how they can be used.  You can also invent your own games and we encourge you to play with and guide your kids so you can all have fun together.

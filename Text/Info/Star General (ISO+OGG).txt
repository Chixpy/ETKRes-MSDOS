Take control of The Fleet (humans), the Khalians, or five other races as you battle for control of the local cluster with your fleet and conquer enemy planets with your group troops. Build research centers to obtain better ships. Use your racial special unit to gain advantage on the ground or in space. Play random map or one of the built-in scenarios that can vary from one ship vs. one ship to full galactic war (variable galaxy sizes). Are you worthy of the title Star General?

Star General can be best described as "Panzer General in Space". Turn-by-turn, the ships in Star General move exactly like the ground units move in Panzer General. "Spatial features" like nebula, cosmic string, and such work exactly like "terrain" on earth. Even the combat mechanics are nearly identical, where ships are rated in missile and beam values, like the ground units are rated in hard vs. soft assault values. It has several novel features though. Inclusion of a full AI capable of playing to death instead of relying on turn-limits is a first. Having the ground units land on planets after the space war concluded and fight a separate ground battle. Research is minimal (only 4 generic levels) and ships cannot be customized. This game is Panzer General with a space theme.

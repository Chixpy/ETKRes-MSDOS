Classic Jumpman is a remake of the classic Jumpman game. (Woah! Shocking, isn"t it? Isn"t it a good thing I"m writing such insightful comments on these games?) Anyways, this remakes captures almost exactly the look/feel/sounds etc of the original PC game, and should run on most modern computers. Of course, I can"t say for sure whether your particular Windows setup will like this game or not. ;)

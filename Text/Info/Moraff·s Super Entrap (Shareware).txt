"NOW WITH FULL MOUSE SUPPORT! BLOW WINDOWS AWAY! Stunning is the only way to describe the graphics in this 3D maze game. The player is found standing on a massive playing field that stretches off far into the distance. The playing field is shown suspended in space, and, when played in 256 color mode, the background can be seen to move and change colors constantly.

The objective is to reach the other end of the playing field without being caught by the enemy robots that roam the surface of the maze. The player has the ability to modify the maze as he progresses through it, creating traps for the enemy robots. At first, this is quite easy, as the robots have intelligence roughly equivalent to that of a dead fish. As the game progresses, however, the enemies become both more intelligent and more capable, as they also begin to modify the maze.

This is a logic game of the highest order, with 3D graphics rivaled only by Moraff"s World. Moraff"s Super Entrap appeals to people of any age, but it has particular appeal to those people who feel they can leave no puzzle unsolved."

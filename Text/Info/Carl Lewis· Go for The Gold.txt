Similar to Carl Lewis Challenge, The but with older graphics and more emphasis on arcade reflexes than the above game, this is a neat "beer-and-pretzel" style game that lets you compete in any of the main athletic events that range from 100m dash to javelin.Despite the lack of depth, it does include excellent database of event rules and help on game elements.

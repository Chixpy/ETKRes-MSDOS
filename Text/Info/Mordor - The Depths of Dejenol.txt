Over fifteen hundred years ago, the dwarves built the mines and the city above them, Dejenol. After centuries of digging, a floor gave way deep in the mines, and monsters began to pour out, killing the miners. The mines were eventually sealed, and remained so for over a thousand years. Now, the city elders have decided to reopen the mines, and cleanse them of their evil inhabitants. Having nearly run out of experienced adventurers, the city elders have decided to train new adventurers to take up this task. You are one such adventurer, tasked with searching and making safe The Depths of Dejenol.

The player forms a party by creating several characters of various races, and causing each to join some guilds to teach them useful skills. The party then adventures in the mines to gain experience, items, and gold, which may be spent at any of the several stores in order to buy equipment, companions, or information from the seer, as well as to gain levels at a guild or revive fallen characters.

Mordor has fifteen dungeon levels in addition to the town, 366 different items, and 400 different monsters, providing many hours of play.

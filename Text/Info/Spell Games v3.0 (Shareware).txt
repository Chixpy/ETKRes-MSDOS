SPELL GAMES is a game to help you practice spelling.  The game displays a word on the screen for an instant, then you must spell the word by typing it on the keyboard. 
                                                                       
The game pits your country against an opponent.  Each time you spell a word correctly, your team wins a point.  If you make a mistake, your opponent gains a point.  A board containing nine flags must be filled for one team to win.

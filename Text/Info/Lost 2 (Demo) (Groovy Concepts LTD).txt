You are playing around with a metel detector in your backyard, when you pick up a signal. After digging for a while, you find a large metal box. 

You find inside; a note and a rock. The note reads:


Dear Gerfy Flertmunder (thats you!)

My name is The Ancient, and I have been kidnapped by an evil creature called The Enforcer. 

The Enforcer is a vicious creature that I have only read about. It"s very big and very powerful. 

I was kidnapped about 2000 years before you were born... so your year is about 1999. 

After you rescued me, I got in my time machine, went into the future to your yesterday,  and planted this note. Now you have to go back in time to rescue me so that the whole paradox works out. Please hurry! 

-The Ancient 
(Printed on recycled paper)

You look at the rock. There is a little red jewel on it. 

You touch it and instantly, you get this kind of fuzzy feeling, like your in a dream. Then things start changing around you, until you find yourself in what looks like a forest. 

Man, oh man you sure did it this time!

That was LOST 1. After completing several tasks, you were able to find the next magic rock in the Ancients house. The rock transported you into the middle of a desert island. The desert island is one of four islands that make up the Lost Islands.

All you have to do is find the Enforcers turf, rescue the Ancient and convince him to return you to your own time. Simple.

"This game is in the time-honoured tradition of text-only adventures, the concept behind which being that your mind is capable of painting far more vivid pictures than mere computer graphics could achieve.

YOU are the central figure in the story, and you will be presented with a series of problems & puzzles in your course to the final solution. Thes problems will frequently require you to possess certain items obtained from elsewhere in the game and to use them in a particular way. It would be unwise to assume that any single item has only one use!"

Gladiator Warz is a futuristic, yet medieval combat game for two people. The two players have a few items for them to use. They are Teleport Wands, Healing Potions, and Trap Detectors. Those are explained later. When you win, or lose, the game is not over. Just that battle. There is also money involved in each battle. If you win, you get more than if you lost.

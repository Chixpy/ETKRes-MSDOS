You were framed in the vicious murder of Joe Melzer. Nobody believes that you didn"t do it. Why would you, Joe"s best friend, kill him?\u0009One week before Joe"s death on Devil"s Night 1998, you and Joe got in a huge fight. He said that Coal Chamber was the best band in the world, and thought that it should be Rammstein. After you both agreed that neither was the best, you asked Joe for your money that he owed you. Joe borrowed some money from you some time ago and never paid you back. He swore on the Bible that he paid back the loan. You two got in a fight again and this time Joe kicked your @$$. Every body knew that you two had been having disagreements. One week later you were brought home by a police officer for being outside at 2:00 AM on Devil"s Night. The next Monday at school you found out that Joe had been killed. It was definitaly a murder and it happened at about 2 in the morning on Oct. 30th. On your way back from school you were stopped by the cops. They hauled you to jail for killing your friend, Joe Melzer. At about 10:45 PM you excaped and ran about 3 miles from the jail. The police cought up to you and tried to re-arrest you. Because you were a wanted murderer, he tried to take you down. That"s where the fighting begins.

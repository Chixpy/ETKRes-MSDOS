Casino Tournament of Champions is yet another game in Capstone"s long line of casino products which began with Trump Castle in 1990.Like the Trump Castle games, CTC boasts all your favorite casino games and a comprehensive tournament play - this time with modem and network support so you could compete against other human players. You can play blackjack, craps, roulette, mini-baccarat, 15 slot machines, video poker, and 7 types of poker. The graphics are much improved over Trump Castle 3, but they are quite primitive compared to contemporary casino games, such as Beat the House, a far more polished title. 

Aside from the new multiplayer options, there is little that makes CTC different from Capstone"s previous casino games. The law of diminishing returns seems to be at work here: with each new title, Capstone adds less and less new features. Amateurish graphics and annoying sounds don"t make things better, either. Definitely not the brightest spot in Capstone"s flagship genre, CTC will appeal only to casino game collectors who want to play it only for completeness" sake. Play Lucky"s Casino or Beat the House instead.

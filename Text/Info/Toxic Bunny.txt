Toxic Bunny is a violent side-scrolling action platform game. The player plays a bunny named Toxic. Toxic becomes super aggressive when his coffee break has been interrupted due to the earth being covered in decaffeinated goo and his friends getting brainwashed. It is up to you to find the one responsible for this.

The game features 4 large levels to play through. Toxic can walk, jump and shoot at various different enemies. In the levels Toxic can collect different coloured elixirs, which can be mixed together to form various different power-ups such as health potions or an explosive.

Back when pinball was king, "video games" were unheard of. That is, until
Pong and Space Invaders changed all that. When Pong was first released, and
later Space Invaders, people didn"t think the trend would last. Well, it

the office network.

Space Invaders was the first "real" arcade game. It contained all the basic
elements that make the best games today so good. Edge of your seat game play,
missiles and bombs everywhere, and a challenge to be reckoned with.

I"m sure you all know what Space Invaders is all about, but I"ll deliver a
quick refresher for those of us that are too old to remember, and those of
us that are too young to know...

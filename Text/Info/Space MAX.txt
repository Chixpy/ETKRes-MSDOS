Manage the build-up and operation of a space station in this management/business simulation.Space MAX is one of the more interesting games of this genre, which flooded the German market in the late 80"s and early 90"s-- and one of the best of its kind. A quality game into the last detail, and after all it"s much more fun to manage a NASA space-station instead of a wineyard as seen in Winzer. Not as strategy-oriented as Interplay"s Buzz Aldrin"s Race into Space, as the emphasis here is on simulation. Overall, probably one of the best space station simulations ever made-- much better than Accolade"s Apollo 18 and more realistic than Karl Buiter"s classic Earth Orbit Stations, althought arguably not as playable. 

Note: the download here includes both the official German version, and the never-before-seen English version that was finished, but never released. Big thanks to Dan who contributed the English text files he got from one of StarByte"s programmers :)

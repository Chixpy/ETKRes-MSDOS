Chess is one of the oldest PC games ever made: it was written in March, 1980 and converted to IBM PC in December, 1981. This is probably the very first chess game running in MS-DOS.

Taking it"s age into account, it"s no surprise that the game features only text-mode graphics. The chess board and the pieces are drawn using ASCII characters. For the same reason, it"s also no surprise that the user input is based just on keyboard commands.

In Chess there is no multiplayer mode - you play only against the computer. As usual, in this kind of game, you can select the A.I."s skill level.

The game offers 24 difficulty levels.

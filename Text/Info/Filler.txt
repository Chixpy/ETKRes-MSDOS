In this two-player board game, players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangular diamonds of seven different colors. Players select one of these colors by turns. As a result of selection, all diamonds of selected color adjacent to player"s territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Chosen color is locked for the opponent for one turn. The winner is a player who first controls more than half of the terrain.

The game may be played against the computer or a human opponent. Board size and time limit may be adjusted.

The game was originally made in Russian, but later it was localized in English, enhanced, and released outside the U.S.S.R. as 7 Colors by Infogrames.

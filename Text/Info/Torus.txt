It may have been inspired by Klax, but in general Torus is quite a unique game. Very uncommonly, it can run either in high resolution VGA or low resolution EGA (Ishido is another example of this rare combination).

In 1996, Yun Sung released an arcade machine conversion Torus. This is probably the only coin-op based on a freeware PC game.

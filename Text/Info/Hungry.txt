"Long, long time ago, far away in the galaxy ... Your enemy is nearly out of food supply. As time goes, however, he found out that you are on the same planet (enjoying). So, he is going to take and steal (and eat too) all the supply you got. That"s why we call this game HUNGRY. (But actually, we named it and think of the story after we have done the game.)

HUNGRY? - Is a kind of board game. The objective of this game is very easy - the more you eat your enemy"s token, you win (that"s all).

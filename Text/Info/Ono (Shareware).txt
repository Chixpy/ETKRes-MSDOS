The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards by matching either colors or numbers and face patterns. Player turns proceed in the order indicated by the arrow at the left. Each player must either play a card that matches the color or pattern of the upturned card at right, play a special wild card, or draw a card if no matches or plays can be made. To play a card in your hand, point to it with the mouse arrow and click the mouse button. The card will be placed on the play stack (if legal) and the next player will try to make a match.

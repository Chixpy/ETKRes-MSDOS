This masterpiece by Bob Bates is almost flawless, except for the fact that the plot is outlined almost entirely in the documentation, and there is little plot development as the game progresses.As futuristic cop, you must journey back to different time periods to stop a mad scientist from altering history. Time Quest is one of my most favorite adventure games ever, and also one of the hardest. Be prepared for a lot of note-taking... which will pay off handsomely as you watch one of the best endings ever seen in a computer game. A true classic that noone should pass up.

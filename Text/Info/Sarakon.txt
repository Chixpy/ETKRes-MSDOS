Saralon is an entertaining Chinese-flavored puzzle game.Uses some ideas from Activision"s earlier classic Mahjongg game Shanghai, though with different rules and offers more than enough of its own to not be considered a clone. Nicely presented; fun, especially if you like puzzlers. The manual is in German. I won"t translate it... me lazy webmaster ;) 

Recommended, especially to anyone who likes Mahjongg variants or Oriental board games in general who wants a more challenging game that relies less on luck than skills. Two thumbs up!

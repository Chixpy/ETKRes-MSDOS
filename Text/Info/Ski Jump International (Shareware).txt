This game simulates the ski jump event, an olympic event which I was personally never much interested in, but this athletic competition has been transformed into a realistic game of reflexes and timing. The object is simply to jump as far as possible, over some nicely drawn winter landscapes. The keyboard keys used for the jumping process are rather complicated, so make sure to read the instructions before playing.

Daily Crossword Puzzles is a decent but small collection of daily crossword puzzles from the NY Times.The game includes only 15 puzzles, although they are all quite interesting. The interface is clean and easy to use: you can read all the clues at once, and get either a letter or word hint. A fun diversion, but little else. After you finish this small collection, check out the New York Times website where you can now play daily crosswords for free, as well as subscribe to premium content.

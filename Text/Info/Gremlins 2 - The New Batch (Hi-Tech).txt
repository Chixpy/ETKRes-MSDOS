A much worse adaptation of the hit movie license than the platform game of the same name by Elite Systems, Hi-Tech"s Gremlins 2: The New Batch is tedious to the extreme.The goal is simple: rid a building of pesky gremlins. Armed with a flashlight, you will make your way through dozens of arduous floors, moving up to the next once a floor is cleared of gremlins. Each floor looks almost identical to the last one, with the same assortment of hamburgers (restore health), batteries (power flashlight), and bonus items to collect. There is only a few gremlins on the lower floors, who can be "killed" quickly by shining the flashlight at them, but you will encounter the meaner sort once you get beyond level 15 or so. Fortunately, you will come across a camera that serves as a better weapon against these guys.

There"s really not much to recommend the game for. If you are fan of the movie, the game provides very little plot development (i.e. nil) and excitement to keep you coming back. The levels look alike, the monsters look alike, gameplay is very claustrophobic, and graphics is below average for its time. Play Elite Systems" version instead if you want to try a Gremlins game.

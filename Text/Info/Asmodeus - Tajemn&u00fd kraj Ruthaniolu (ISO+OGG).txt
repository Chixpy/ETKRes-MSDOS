Asmodeus is a Czech-made mix between adventure game and dungeon-crawling RPG, that was rendered in 3D but each screen was then redrawn by hand. Apart from several rendered animations in the exteriors, the movement is step-based. Combat is real-time and during each round you can either attack enemy or parry. Enemies have several hit-zones and each of them have certain weak spot which the player has to discover first. There is always just one opponent in every fight but they can spawn randomly during each step the player takes and one can"t escape the battle nor use healing. 

NOTA: Su dificultad era tan alta que nadie consiguió terminarlo en su momento, por lo que los autores decidieron modificarlo de forma que agregándole números detrás del ejecutable del tipo 20, 40, etc. entras al juego con una reducción de la dificultad del 20%, 40%, etc.

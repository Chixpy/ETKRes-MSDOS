Another solid fantasy adventure based on the Kobyashi Naruengine, Shard of Inovar is a more traditional adventure.You are a royal wizard who must invoke various rituals to reconstruct the cairnrue, a magical barrier that protects the earth from pestilence that falls from the sky. The game"s interface is basically identical to Inovar, but with additional verbs and more logical placement of verb icons (thank goodness). The puzzles are easy and fair, and the plot is interesting enough to warrant playing to the end. Overall, a pleasant adventure that doesn"t offer anything new, but is competent at what it does.

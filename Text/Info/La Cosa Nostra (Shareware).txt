"La Cosa Nostra is an action-packed 3D game with blazing 256 color VGA graphics and HOT animation. Barrel your way through 5 floors of a mafia-infested mansion to save your kidnapped wife! Requires VGA graphics. Sound card is optional.

The story surrounds a number of events which have happened in your life recently. Your name is Slade A. Ryker and you are an investigator for the New York City Police Department. Your best friend was named J. Walter Kelly, your homicide investigator partner. You and he grew up together, went to college together, went through the academy together.

You were the best of friends.

Walt Kelly"s sister was named Monica. Monica Kelly had attended law school and had just recently been promoted within the ranks of the Westchester County District Attorney"s office to assistant D.A.

You and she had been dating for nearly three years and had just gotten married less than a month ago.

The three of you were now inextricably bound in each others lives. But that peace was shattered when Monica, working late one night saw her brother murdered by two known mafia hitmen. She instantly recognized them and their connection to the Girabaldi family, whom she was preparing a case against secretly.

She attempted to escape, to run away. But they chased her down and, with the butt of a weapon crashing hard against her skull, knocked her out cold.

Yesterday you received the ransom note from Girabaldi himself. He made no bones about having Walt murdered and later dumped into the river. And he made no pretense about having Monica in his home on Girabaldi Hill.

In fact, he dared you to come and save her!"

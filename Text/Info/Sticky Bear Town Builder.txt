Sticky Bear Town Builder is one of the first titles in Optimum Resource"s popular Sticky Bear line of educational titles that is still going strong after more than a decade.Unfortunately unlike later games in the series, Town Builder does not offer a whole lot of edutainment value. Designed for pre-schoolers, Town Builder lets kids design a town by placing buildings and roads, then drive a car through the city. The educational value in the game are pattern recognition skills and route optimization taught during the driving action: the game shows the picture of the building or location you are supposed to drive to next, and you must go there using the quickest route lest your fuel runs out. With limited buildings and narrow edutainment value, Town Builder is not as interesting or educational as later Sticky Bear games, but kids who like Lego will probably enjoy this early underdog anyway.

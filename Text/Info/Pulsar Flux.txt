Another rare arcade game from the developers of the unknown, unknown, but it is really great. A particular history of the plot does not (hooray!). The action takes place in the distant and bleak future, our hero - a small round of combat robot (but relatively humanoid and armed), whose mission - to destroy the sinister corporation alone, sitting on a distant planet and producing there terrible drug. Naturally, the robot will try to stop serving corporations other robots and various mutant monsters, which will need to fight. Pulsar Flux - is not the only platform: periodically the game will occur puzzle (not difficult, however). Graphically the game looks great - picture painted, amazingly bright and clear, and most importantly - perfectly conveys the atmosphere of a mysterious planet (which are nothing but giant mushrooms!). So, as in many other cases, the game just two advantages: it is both the perfect gift for any fan, and good old platformer, and collector of various rarities and curiosities.

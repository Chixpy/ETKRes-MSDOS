"DOMINATION is basically a board game which would be rather difficult to play on a board due to the complexity of the explosions involved.

DOMINATION is played on a 12x10 square grid. Each square can hold a number of counters, the maximum being called the critical mass of that square.

The critical mass is defined by the number of squares directly adjacent to it. So the corner square would have a critical mass of 2, a side square a critical mass of 3 and a middle square a critical mass of 4. A hole in the board subtracts 1 from the critical mass of all squares directly adjacent to it.

Each player takes it in turns to place a counter on the board. A player can only place a counter in a square which is either directly adjacent to a square already containing one of their counters or in a square which already contains one of their counters.

When the number of counters in a square reaches critical mass the square explodes. That square will then contain no counters but each adjacent square will have had 1 counter added to it. Each square which gets a counter placed into it from an explosion is claimed by the player who started the explosion.

An explosion in a field of squares which are just under their critical mass can lead to a chain reaction of explosions, and cause the entire face of the board to change dramatically! Hence the name of the game ""DOMINATION""."

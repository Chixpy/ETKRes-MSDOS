One of many translations of the famous mainframe BASIC game, and quite possibly the first ever on the PC.  Like its ancestors, it is a turn-based, text-based strategy game set in a randomly-generated galaxy.  From the Captain"s chair on the Enterprise, you get a (random) amount of time to blast a (random) number of Klingon warships out of the sky, and a (random) number of starbases where you can get your R&R.

The game world is a grid of 64 quadrants, each with 64 sectors.  In this version, all travel is by means of the warp drive: course can be set in eight directions, and the warp factor determines the distance covered.  For memorability"s sake, the regions of the galaxy get actual names.  As in other variants, weapons, shields and engines all consume energy, and your combat arsenal includes phasers (which automatically lock on target) and photon torpedoes (aimed manually).

Ship systems may be damaged in battle, and their status is tracked individually; your scanners will help you get your bearings, and the library computer provides a host of useful functions. Your prowess as Captain is evaluated at the end of the mission... whether the Enterprise is in one piece or not.

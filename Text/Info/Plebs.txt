Plebs is a simple bouncing game, similar to the classic PC Booter game "Bouncing Babies." Here the object is to bounce various "plebs" (which in this case refers to any sort of humanoid person, animal, etc) across the screen from right to left. Each level has a challenge you"re working towards which rapidly seem to get tricky. The graphics are decent enough (the rotating plebs are neat) but there really isn"t a lot of depth in the gameplay here.

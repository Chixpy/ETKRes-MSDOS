The object of Tri is to collect all of the items on the screen. However, your "Tri" can only move in straight horizontal or vertical lines, and will continue moving until it hits an item or is destroyed by hitting an obstacle or going off the screen. Although the levels are randomly generated it doesn"t matter much until you hit the later levels. Graphics are passable, and the tileset changes every few levels. A decent but not-too-mentally taxing puzzle game. (Note: Press Enter to use a "pass"; some levels can"t be completed otherwise. See in-game help for an explanation.)

Anchorhead is a horror-themed interactive fiction game set in a Lovecraftian dilapidated fishing village.  After a gruesome death ends the Verlac family line, a young couple, from a distant branch of the family, inherit the ancestral mansion.  The player takes on the role of the wife in this horror-themed interactive fiction game, exploring the mansion and the town, talking to its denizens, and uncovering the mystery that hangs like a miasma over the town. 

The plot is divided into three days, but - save for a few time-critical puzzles - the player need not hurry, as time only progresses after puzzles are solved.

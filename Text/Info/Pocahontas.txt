Made before Disney"s blockbuster animated movie of the same name and the subsequent game, GT Interactive"s Pocahontas is an average true-to-the-story side-scrolling platformer that brings you back to the time when the Native Americans, with all their spiritual wisdom and kinship with nature, were attempting to live in harmony with the new English settlers.You will begin the game with Pocahontas as she seeks out her Shamanic guide to help her overcome obstacles and to keep peace between the white man and her people. In Level one, Pocahontas uses her agility to collect at least twenty feathers to exchange them with the Shaman woman for magic cards that help Pocahontas throughout her journey. Level Two finds Pocahontas trying to get through the forest while avoiding the spirit bear. In Level Three, you will switch to control John Smith, the American explorer, as he needs to shoot enough animals before night time while avoiding the bear. The next two levels alternate controls between Pocahontas and John Smith, culminating in the final level (seven) where you will control both Pocahontas and John Smith.

Although the levels are diverse and tie directly to the story"s plot, the game overall suffers from awkward character movements and the too difficult gameplay that is best left to expert gamers only. Worth a look, but action game beginners should look elsewhere for their fix.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of Wall Pipe is to try to keep the water flowing
as long as possible by placing down pipe links to direct its flow.



GAME PLAY / CLOCK

On the left side of the screen, you will see 4 different shaped
pipes.  The mouse cursor will be on top of the bottom pipe.
Clicking the mouse button will make the pipe disappear and the
mouse cursor will then appear on the game board itself.  Clicking
the mouse button again, will place that pipe onto the game board.

When the game begins, there is a clock located on the left side
of the screen.  At the first level, you will have 40 seconds to
place pipes before the water starts to begin flowing from the
Water Well which is light blue.  Once the water has begun to flow,
you can still keep placing pipes down on the game board in order
to keep ahead of the onrushing water.

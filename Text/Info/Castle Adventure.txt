This game is like a cross between a Kroz game and a text adventure -- the player moves through a castle using the arrow keys, picking up equipment and battling monsters in real-time along the way; however, at any time, it is also possible to type simple commands into the game"s text parser, allowing a greater variety of actions and more complex solutions to problems.  The object of the game is to escape from the 83-room castle while collecting as many of the thirteen available treasures as possible.

Despite amatuer graphics and a cliched plot, this RPG"s depth and playability (which runs smoothly on a 286) may surprise you.The game can be a bit tough at times, but not overly difficult. Most of the puzzles in it are simple. The only complaints I have are a couple quests which you can complete without actually doing them (yes, you heard me right)-- an annoying bug that one might consider a boon. 

All in all, an underrated and one of the better shareware RPGs that is worth a look. 

Note: Although the game advertises two more episodes, they unfortunately were never made. This version for download here, i.e. the registered version of the first episode, is the only one that was released to the public

Trouble is in Cobra City! Gangsters roam the streets, and gang bosses seem to have taken the power in the city. Who is responsible for the situation? It is up to you, the private investigator JR Knight, and your lovely companion Faythe, to find out what is going on!

Cobra Mission is based on an  earlier Japanese-only game of the same name, but was developed from scratch and has many important differences that make it an independent title rather than a port.

Like the original game, it is a Japanese anim√©-style RPG with erotic content. The game takes place in Cobra City, a large town divided into several parts. The player navigates the characters through the city in top-down view, visiting various buildings, talking to people, gathering information, and fighting random enemies. During battles, the game switches to first-person perspective. 

Unlike the Japanese-only earlier release, the battles are not turn-based. The player must click on the picture of the enemy in real time to inflict damage. The mouse cursor is always slightly moving during battles, which makes aiming more difficult. Many enemies have weak and strong areas, and it is necessary to aim precisely in order to have success. 

After major quests, the protagonists rescues girls who will be grateful, giving him their telephone numbers. It is then possible to visit them and participate in erotic mini-games: The player is given a certain number of turns, during which he has to perform the correct actions to seduce the girl successfully. 

Many locations and characters were completely re-designed, and story events added or altered. There are also more different enemy types and many more items to find in this version.

Breakline is a Breakout variant. You have a paddle which bounces a ball up and down to break blocks on the game field.

You can activate several special abilities, e.g. releasing several balls at once or a ball which cuts through solid blocks. The levels include gimmicks like teleporters or bumpers.

There is also a training mode in which you can select the individual levels.

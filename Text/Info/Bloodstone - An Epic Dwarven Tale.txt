A group of evil goblin-like creatures known as Taldor have attacked the clan to which the hero of the game belongs. In order to defeat the Taldor, the protagonist must assemble a party of adventurers, unite the warring tribes of the North and the South, and procure the ancient powerful axe Khamalkhad. Meanwhile, the minions of darkness will do anything in their power to stop the heroes...

Bloodstone: An Epic Dwarven Tale is a prequel to the Magic Candle games. It utilizes the same engine as the third game in the series, and has a very similar gameplay. Turn-based battles take place in the same area as the exploration, without switching to separate combat screens. A few tweaks were applied to the gameplay; for example, characters no longer get tired when traveling.

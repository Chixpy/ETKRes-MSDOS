Austerlitz, just as the previous title from the same authors, is a tile-based wargame played in real-time - a rare trait in that period. The player takes command of either French or Russo-Austrian armies in the Battle of Austerlitz, fought on 2 December 1805 (which ended as a massive defeat of Third Coalition forces).

You may play the complete battle, portion of it, or an alternative scenario. Fatigue and morale affects the infantry, cavalry and artillery on the battlefield.

The object of the game is to use all 52 cards from the Pyramid, deck, and discard pile by discarding cards that total 13 into the trash can. Cards are worth face value, having Aces worth 1, Jacks worth 11, Queens worth 12, and Kings worth 13. Cards can be selected from the pyramid, the deck, or the top of the discard pile. To select cards equaling 13, click on the first card, move it to the second card, click on it, and if the cards add up to 13, you can then move then to the trash can, click, and they will be discarded. If they do not add up to 13, they will be returned to their original positions. If they do add up to 13, and are discarded, the card counter will be advanced. If all the cards are discarded to the trash can, you win the game, otherwise try again!

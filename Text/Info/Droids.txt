Droids is a strategy game for one to four players. There are four droids on Mercury which are used to retrieve minerals. The game board is a 15x10 grid which represents the planets surface. Each grid location starts out with a mineral that the droids can retrieve. During the game players take turns selecting one of the droids, and giving it a direction to move. The droid will keep moving in the selected direction for as long as it is able to retrieve minerals. The game ends when all four of the droids have become trapped (i.e. no more moves can be made), and whoever retrieved the most minerals wins!

"Skull Quest ][ is more difficult than SQ1, since more things are hidden or in out-of-the-way places. Additionally, more illusionary walls and floors have been used (and remember, they can not be detected by throwing bones at them, since the bones bounce off as if the wall were real). On top of that, no one ever gives you a ""recharge"". However, the ending graphics are worth the added effort to get there.

STORYLINE:

Over two centuries ago you were one of the many followers of Lord Trentarus. He was a fair and just leader, although slightly morbid. To insure his continuing reign, and continued victory over enemies, he ordered his best mages to create a powerful magical device for him. He also ordered that it be a sarcophagus so that he may be buried in it, and thus be one with it through eternity. Hence the Cyan Sarcophagus was created. It was made out of pure wizidrium, the most magically potent element known to mankind.

Lord Trentarus also ordered his followers to construct a large crypt, and bury him and the sarcophagus in it upon his death. The order didn"t stop there, as all of his followers were to seal themselves in with him.

Finally the day came when Lord Trentarus was laid to rest, and everyone entered the crypt. You were the one charged with the unenviable task of sealing the doors to the crypt, and to guard them against grave robbers.

Two centuries have passed, and then a new threat emerged. But it didn"t come through the doors, it came from the central tomb, from the sarcophagus itself! A creature, known only as the null-beast, attempted to tap the power of the sarcophagus to open a gateway through which it could enter our world. However, you thwarted the beasts attempt by neutralizing the sarcophagus with another peice of wizidrium.

Not much time has passed, and now a new threat has emerged. The entire crypt is being shaken to peices by ground-ripping earthquakes, and the Null-Beast is back! Can you stop it in time?"

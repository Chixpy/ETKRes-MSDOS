R-Space is a text adventure game that I almost didn"t even remember until I stumbled across it in my back-ups. You take the role of Viktor, originally a maintenance robot on a starship, now turned intelligent and self-aware, and the ship is doomed. You have 30 minutes to escape the ship. It"s a simplistic game, but interesting anyway. You will need to have ANSI.SYS loaded in your config.sys file in order to see a display in the intro that shows information about the ship, and to see the winning The End screen. You also need a CGA compatible graphics device (who doesn"t?).

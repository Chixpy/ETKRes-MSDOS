Magnetic Scroll"s last adventure game (before they designed the inferior adventure/RPG hybrid The Legacy: Realm of Terror for Microprose) is in my opinion the best game they produced, filled with memorable characters, creative and challenging puzzles, and excellent windows-based interface, refined from Collection 1, that gives the player both the power of direct interaction with the parser and menu-based creation of sentences (similar to Legend"s early games).You are none other than Alice, the hapless heroine of Lewis Carroll"s immortalized "Through The Looking Glass", who inadvertently found herself in a fascinating fantasy world populated by talking animals and objects. In your quest to find your way home, you will interact with many well-written characters that truly capture the spirit of the novel, and solve many puzzles that are challenging yet all very logical. The game"s many time- and location- based puzzles will truly force you to think in three-dimensions and be acutely aware of how long it takes to perform actions, and will give you a great sense of satisfaction when you figure them out. The shrinking/enlarging puzzle remains one of the most memorable puzzles of all time. Don"t consider yourself an IF lover without playing this game!

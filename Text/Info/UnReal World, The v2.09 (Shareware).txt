"UrW is highly realistic computer fantasy role-playing game. This means you will create an imaginary character who"s life you will share - your character wanders around the world controlled by you.

Your objective in UrW is simply to live. Some campaigns however include quests that you can (but not necessarily have to) accomplish. In lack of specific quests you may explore the environment and try to earn your daily meal somehow. Develop your skills, try to make your life meaningful and see as the world rolls on. UrW is designed to be very close to real role-playing considering the fact that this is still a computer game.

You may freely seek for excitement but remember that the world out there may not be so nice and easy for a rookie."

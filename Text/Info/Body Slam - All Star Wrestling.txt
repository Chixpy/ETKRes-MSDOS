Body Slam All-Star Wrestling is yet another quality title from UK developer Junkyard (formerly Zeppelin Games), who is best know for their Match Day Manager football simulation. Like most games from Zeppelin, BSASW was very little known when it was released in the UK. An arcade-style wrestling game similar to the classic Bob "n Wrestle, BSASW offers single match or full tournament play for one or two players. Crisp VGA graphics, smooth animations, and excellent control scheme (especially for special moves) are the hallmarks of this obscure underdog that deserves to be in the library of every fan of wrestling games. It could benefit from the humor of Bob "n Wrestle, but there is already very little to dislike. If you enjoy the likes of Panza Kick Boxing, you will definitely love this game as well. Highly recommended!

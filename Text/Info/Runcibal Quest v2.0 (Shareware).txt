Runcibal Quest is a shareware (told you that already), text-based (should have been able to guess that one) adventure game.  In it, you are a student at a private English boarding school, located in a medium-sized industrial city.  Set in the mid 1980s, the goal of the game is to gain entrance into Runcibal"s nightclub.

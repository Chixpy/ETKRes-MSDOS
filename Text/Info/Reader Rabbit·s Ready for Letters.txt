Reader Rabbit"s Ready for Letters is another superb release in The Learning Company"s excellent Reader Rabbit edutainment series.Tailored to pre-schoolers, this program contains six activities designed to improve kids" cognitive and early language skills. The activities include: Music Pond, in which kids must find the musicians and direct the animals in familiar songs; Grandma"s Kitchen: find and match ingredients that complete a recipe in Grandma"s cookbook; Mix-and-Match Bedroom: match designs and patterns; ABC Bathroom: match Letters; Picture Parlor: practice working with location and comparison words; and finally Grandpa"s Workshop (in my opinion the best activity): a matching game that lets kids compare shape, size, and color of various objects. Every activity is well-designed, with colorful graphics, intuitive user interface, and superb gameplay that will capture pre-schoolers" interest for hours on end. Yet another excellent release from arguably the best edutainment company. Two thumbs up, way up!

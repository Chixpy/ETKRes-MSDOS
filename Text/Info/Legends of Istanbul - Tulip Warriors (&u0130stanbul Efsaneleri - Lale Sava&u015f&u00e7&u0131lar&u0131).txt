\u0130stanbul Efsaneleri: Lale Sava\u015f\u00e7\u0131lar\u0131 is one of the first Turkish games (first CRPG) ever developed for PCs. The game consists of a lot of different different spells (actually swear words from turkish) and a very different character system.

The story takes place in an alternative Istanbul. You start with a group of four Turkish youngsters who were playing football near an abandoned auto-park. When the ball accidentally went inside the building and of course the youngsters after the ball, they all find themselves in a medieval looking Istanbul. They use all of their training (swearing as spells, waste baskets as shields, and turnips as weapons) to overcome the dangers of this mysterious and evil-infested medieval looking Istanbul, and return to their homes.

The gameplay is from the first-person perspective. You control your party with the keyboard and find your way in the 2D environment. The combats are from an isometric point of view and turn-based.

Controlling a small frog, the player must jump across lillypads towards his goal. These lillypads gradually grow smaller and eventually sink into the water, new lillypads appear to replace them. Enemy bugs will also chase the enemy frog. Touching the bad bugs or the water results in death. The player can collect colored balls for bonus points. As the levels increase, the game speeds up and lillypads become smaller.

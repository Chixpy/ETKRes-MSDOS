In a sense, Fiddle is like a jigsaw puzzle: the player is presented with a series of abstract shapes on a grid and the challenge is to move and rotate them all (without resulting in invalid positions, such as overlapping pieces) into such an arrangement that they ultimately form a complete, filled square. This is relatively trivial on the first tutorial level, but the difficulty escalates through 26 levels, one for every letter of the alphabet. The fewer moves used in the solution of a level, the higher the final score, hence the author encourages a strategic approach of contemplation over a trial-and-error system.

Ravage is an excellent shareware vertical shooter game from Alpha Helix, the maker of cult classic The Last Eichhof freeware shooter.While The Last Eichhof was humorous, wacky shooter, Ravage is a typical sci-fi shooter that boasts futuristic spaceships, menacing motherships, and spectacular explosions.

Just because it"s "typical" doesn"t mean it is not fun. Like The Last Eichhof, the gameplay in Ravage is fun, furious, and highly addictive. You will constantly face nonstop waves of enemy ships that will test your joystick expertise to the limit. The end-level bosses deserve a special mention for being appropriately gigantic, powerful, and tough to beat. In between levels, you can upgrade your battleship in a shop with weapons and other goodies. Ravage even includes a nice 2-player co-operative mode that lets you and your buddy fight enemies on the same screen.

The registered version offers 9 levels of furious mayhem, full source codes, and many new enemy types including ships, tanks, and aircrafts. And best of all, Tritone of Alpha Helix has agreed to let us distribute this now out-of-print registered version free of charge on our site. Big thanks to Tritone, and two thumbs up for an excellent game that will entertain die-hard SHMUP fans for hours on end.

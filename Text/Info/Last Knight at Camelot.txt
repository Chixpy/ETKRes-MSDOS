In the age of King Arthur and his Round Table, Merlin and the king send out a call for a new knight to join the court. The player"s character takes up the challenge to prove himself worthy of the honor, and ultimately must scour the kingdom in search of Excalibur and the Black Knight whose Dwarf minions have stolen it. There are hidden treasure troves, teleports and special items to be found as well.

Last Knight at Camelot is a side-scrolling platformer somewhat in the tradition of Epic MegaGame"s Jill of the Jungle series; the player has no weapons, however, and must either avoid enemies completely or jump on them to defeat them.  The keyboard"s four arrow keys move the knight left and right, enable him to look up and down, climb up and down, move switches and enter doorways; the shift key makes him jump.

Platformer, formally executed in the style of the world legends of King Arthur. Player - has recently become a knight of the young man, whose task is to find the stolen treasures dwarfs Arthur and his sword Excalibur. Type in the game on the side. What upsets (because for such surroundings, in my opinion, not very good) - is the lack of a hero weapons: enemies can only be killed naprygivaniem on them, but this is often not possible, so they just have to run away. But there is a chance to jump, bend, to enter the building. Graphical output for the year looks very weak, unfortunately. Verdict - a game level is not higher than average in places of employment, but given the severe shortage of games on this topic, I"d like to see it in the best performance.

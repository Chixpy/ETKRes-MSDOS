"This is a game that I wrote for Ian, my sixteen month old son. He had seen the rest of the family using the computer, and had become more and more curious about it. He finally got to the point of throwing screaming fits to play on the keyboard. However, when I checked around, I could not find any software usable by such a young child! It just seemed outrageous to waste all the enthusiasm that he was showing; especially for an activity (i.e. computer use) that will be so crucial for all kids. I don"t know how old a child might have to be to play this game, but probably the capability to sit up and explore the keyboard would be needed. That potentially could be quite young! Drop me a note to let me know what happens.

The game uses bright colors, sounds, and basic shapes which change in a semi-random order in response to any key press. The hardware requirements are minimal; a CGA display is needed. I have not tested the game on EGA or VGA, but it should work there too, since the medium-resolution graphics mode is supported by those displays. The game speed should be fine on all different speed PC Compatibles."

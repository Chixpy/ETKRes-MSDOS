The year 2010: computer-viruses have penetrated the network of the world"s most important mega-computer. Everything, from food and energy supply over climate and traffic is depending on this machine. The only chance for humanity to survive is you, a Cyberpilot. You are controlling a virtual virus killer, the Skaphander, flying through 15 different Descent-like levels, hunting down the viruses. The graphics are similar to those in Doom, only more futuristic as a result of the fact you"re flying through a computer network.The game was only released in Germany.

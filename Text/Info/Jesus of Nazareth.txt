The classic text adventure game structure involves a treasure hunt of sorts, collecting exceptional or valuable objects and amassing them in some central repository.  This is a game in much the same fashion, except that instead of objects, you recruit party members.  Oh yes, and did I mention: it"s 28 AD, your name is "Jesus", and your party members are the apostles?

You will roam near and far over the hills and under the caves of Roman Judea running mundane errands, retrieving everyday items and completing missions to satisfy your would-be apostles.  There are no walking-on-water shortcuts and in fact, no instances of miraculous behaviour whatsoever.  Should you die in combat (a nasty, do-or-die piece of work, often producing apparently random results), do not expect resurrection.

Combat?  That"s right -- despite some scriptural inspiration, a generous helping of Biblical diction and a conversational style heavily influenced by parables, completion of the game demands some distinctly un-Christian behavior: closer to The Last Temptation than to The Passion, the creed of WWJD will be insufficient to successfully guide the player through this game.

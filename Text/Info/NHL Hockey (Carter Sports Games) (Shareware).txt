The mechanics of this game are very simple: you select the home and visiting teams, adjust text speed, sound on or off, and whether or not you want home ice advantage. You will then see both team"s rosters with current league stats. Next up is the game screen, where play proceeds in one-minute increments. The play stops after each goal and at the end of each period (unless you selected Super Fast text speed). When the game"s over you see a summary screen for each team listing the goals, assists and penalties for the that game. You then have the option of saving the stats from this game to your league files (if you"re replaying a season you"ll find remarkable statistical accuracy: goals, assists, penalty minutes, power play and short handed goals for skaters; goals against average, shutouts, games played and games won, lost and tied for goalies; wins, losses, ties, goals for and against for teams).

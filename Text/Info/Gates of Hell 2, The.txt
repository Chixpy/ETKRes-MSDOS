This game is set in Post Apocalyptic Earth where you (the player) journeys into the strange caves that lead into Hell.

The Gates of Hell is a gate into hell that opens every thousand years.

In the not so distant future the portal opened letting the demons engineer their destruction on Earth.

In the smoldering ashes of the aftermath a lone warrior was sent into the underworld to close the portal and stop the reign of terror.

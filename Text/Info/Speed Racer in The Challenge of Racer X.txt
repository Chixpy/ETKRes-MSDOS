This Speed Racer-licensed racing game is based on the American remake of 1960s classic Japanese anime TV series. All the main characters are presented in the game: Speed Racer, his big brother Racer X, his father Pops, his mother, his girlfriend Trixie, and his little brother Spritle along with the pet chimpanzee Chim-Chim.

In the game you are Speed Racer who challenges Racer X on the 7 campaign tracks full of obstacles, road gaps, and other racers who want to take your car (Mach 5) off the road. Mach 5 has many features under the hood, which can be activated with the buttons from "A" to "G" (for instance, to make a big jump you press "A", or to survive under water you press "D"). After winning the race you"ll progress in the game to another episode, collecting money as bonus.

Two players can simultaneously take on each other on the same computer or online via modem. There are different episodes in Modem Play.

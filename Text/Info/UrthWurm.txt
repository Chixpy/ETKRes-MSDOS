UrthWurm is an excellent PC version of SFCave, the (in)famous PalmOS worm game coded by SunFlat, a Japanese programmer.This PC version coded by BdR in Turbo Pascal 7.0 is very faithful to the original, and no less addictive. Your objective: guide the urthwurm through 10 levels. The gameplay is deceptively simple: press the SPACEBAR to make the wurm rise, and release it to make the wurm dive. If the wurm hits any part of the cave, it"s game over. The score goes up for as long as your wurm is alive. 
UrthWurm is one of those games that have laughably short learning curve, but will glue you to the screen for hours on end. As a bonus, the special bonus you get at the end of each level is different for each difficulty setting (easy, normal, or hard). Highly recommended, and also check out the on-line Java version below.

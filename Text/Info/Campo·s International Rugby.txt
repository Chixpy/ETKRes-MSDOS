Campo"s International Rugby is a great, and largely unknown, rugby game that is endorsed by David "Campo" Campese, Australian rugby legend, who has set up his own management company after retiring from the game in 1999.

Campo"s fans will not be disappointed with this game that bears his name. Campo"s International Rugby features excellent gameplay, full tournament, league, and practice options, as well as a plethora of coaching choices. Although arguably not as expansive or replayable as Audiogenic?s classic Wembley Rugby League, Campo features a better user interface and smoother action. The game is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer: tiny players are nicely animated, and the controls are both intuitive and easy to learn. Overall, Campo is a great arcade-oriented game that should keep fans of the sport happy for days on end, and definitely deserves better than its relative obscurity. Highly recommended!

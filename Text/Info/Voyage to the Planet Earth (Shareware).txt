In Voyage to the Planet Earth, you are aboard a spacecraft with a spectacular view of the earth. Use the directional keys to move about or zoom in for a closer look. You may view the earth in its natural state or you may view it with the political boundaries marked and the major cities identified. In a navigation challenge function, you are aboard a flying saucer hovering somewhere above the earth; your objective is to find your way home with only your knowledge of geography to guide you.

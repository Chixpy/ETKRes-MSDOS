Similar to the classic game Gauntlet (one of my favs) this game features large dungeons that are explored from an overhead perspective. You choose from three different characters, then explore the dungeons, killing monsters and collecting treasure. The graphics are fairly good, and the sound isn"t too annoying, even though it"s played through the PC speaker. The only real problem with the game is that when the view scrolls, it doesn"t scroll far enough ahead, so it"s sometimes hard to see where you"re going.

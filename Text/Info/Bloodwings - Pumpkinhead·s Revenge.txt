The player controls a keeper of lost souls who is sent into the spirit world to do battle with Pumpkinhead. The game has three levels. In the first level of the game- Periphery- the player watches video clips from the Pumpkinhead movie and grabs items to add to an inventory. The player also seeks out glyphs- one of which must be offered to "The Gatekeeper" to finish the level. In the second level of the game- Purgatory- the player must rescue lost souls and watch video clips depicting the deaths of characters in the movie. The player must use a voodoo doll to stop Pumpkinhead from killing Jenny or Jane, and the player must allow all of the other characters to die. Each slain character will give the player a piece of a medallion or a toy; all of which must be collected for the third level. In the third and final level of the game, the player enters Pumpkinhead"s lair and must give Pumpkinhead his favorite childhood toy in order to calm his soul so he may rest in peace. The player may fight Pumpkinhead instead for an alternate ending where Pumpkinhead"s body is destroyed, but his spirit awaits the player"s return to the netherworld.

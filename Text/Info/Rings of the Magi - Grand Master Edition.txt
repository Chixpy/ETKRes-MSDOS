In this top-down perspective of a "board" game, you have colored rings (blue, green, yellow, red and purple ones), and you must join them together, so they can disappear, and you get the points for their disappearance. If you have, for example, let"s take it three rings, and you join two of the same color, you won"t have match for the third one, so you won"t be able to finish the level, unless you undo your move. Arrows on the table buttons shows in which direction(s) will rings be moved one square, and that"s basically how you move the rings. Every level is accompanied by a very nice tune, and there are different settings for expert players, or for the beginners. The game also includes its easy to use editor for the levels.

Guilty is a graphic adventure game with a icon-based point-and-click interface.

It is the sequel to Innocent Until Caught.

Jack T. Ladd, notorious thief and would-be nightmare of the galaxy, has suddenly got female company. Rather involuntary, that is. Ysanne Andropath is not only a stunning red-head, but also a cop. So she throws Jack into a cell on her spaceship and heads off for stellar jail, when disaster strikes. The problem isn"t that first thing Jack does, is escaping his cell. The problem isn"t even that second thing Jack does, is dumping the ships hyperdrive out into space. But now, Ysanne is forced to work together with Mr. Trouble. THAT"s what she calls disaster.

Using the familiar, slightly overhauled interface, you set off for another adventure to save the galaxy. You can play the game alternatively as the incorrigible macho Jack or the tough feminist Ysanne. In either role you"ll be visiting the same places, but solve entirely different puzzles. For example, on the same planet, Ysanne has to stop an advancing army, whilst Jack tries to steal back the spaceships lost navigational device. On rare occasions, the two even have to engage in teamwork.

Guilty, like its predecessor, uses rendered flight scenes for the spacecraft landing and taking off. The CD version of the game adds full speech for the two protagonists.

One of the most popular new games/fads of the 21st century comes to DOS! Finally! :) This "Sudoku for DOS" version includes three different difficulty modes. If you have never played Sudoku before, Wikipedia explains it thusly: "The aim of the puzzle is to enter a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9\u00d79 grid made up of 3\u00d73 subgrids, starting with various digits given in some cells; each row, column, and region must contain only one instance of each numeral." This is a decent free option to play on your PC.

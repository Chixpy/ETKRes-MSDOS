Over the past few weeks, Jonathan had been having disturbing dreams at night. Floating out in space, he would speak to a figure that shone bright white. It would ask him to help take over the world. When he refused, the thing struck him down with a horrible sword. Then he would wake up. 

At school, one morning, he resolved to tell his friends about the dreams, but never got the chance. Mr. Butler, the band director, called them up and told them about a motivational speaker. A man named Dr. Biose Sinclair. 

The man was rude and seemed self absorbed. He talked until Mr. Butler literally kicked him out of the band hall. Jonathan, meanwhile, was asleep, talking to God in another dream. God told him exactly where to go, that he would find all the information he needed to have Dr. Sinclair arrested. 

The game picks up the story when Jonathan enters the woods to find the files. Your objective is to guide him through to the end, when he solves the mystery and puts an end to this bizarre occurrence.

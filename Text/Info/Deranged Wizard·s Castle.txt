A generation ago, King Zidjilan ruled Lomano city from a great castle. However, the castle was haunted.  The king beleived that if the castle was filled with confusing mazes and secret passages, the castle would not attract as many monsters and demons.  So, the king hired several wizards to design and magically build complicated mazes throughout the castle.

When the wizards finished their job, they left town.  Unfortunately, the wizards did too good a job.  For it was then impossible to get to many of the places in the castle easily or safely. The king and queen both died by falling into pits that were part of the mazes. The death of the king caused an uproar in the city.

Then, all of a sudden, the city was attacked by skilled, heavily-armed warriors.  These warriors were the best in the land.  Even the city"s well-trained knights were no match for them.  Every resident of Lomano city was slaughtered.  The castle never was guarded, so the warriors entered the castle with ease.  They asked the castle workers where the treasury had been stored. The workers did not know at all, since they were never told themselves. So, the warriors locked the workers in the castle cellar to starve to death.  

Next, the warriors searched for the treasury.  All but one of them, a deranged man, died looking for it.  This remaining warrior was also a wizard. He did not find any money or treasures, but he did find the secret to returning the castle back to normal.  To this day, he remains well-hidden in the castle, protecting the secret.  He also waits for a bold adventurer to discover him and accept his final challenge.

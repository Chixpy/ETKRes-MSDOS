The Gate is for version 1.4/1.5. It has 24 levels and the file is 15.7MB in size. The file name is gate.zip. It was released on May 1, 1997.

The Gate has good level design with many huge levels. Lots of detail and the use of bright colors in indoor areas. The gameplay is also good but can get very hard at times. Some new aliens have been speeded up so much you can see the trails they leave behind when they move. Other than being hard I rate it as very good with 4 out of 5 stars.

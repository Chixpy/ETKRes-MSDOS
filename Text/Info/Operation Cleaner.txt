Operation Cleaner is a Finnish freeware game exploring a very unique genre of gaming: demolition of buildings. The player is in charge of a demolition company, and the goal is to bring down buildings of the clients with as little explosives and collateral damage as possible.

For simplicity and due to the age of the game the buildings are represented as 2D cross sections with all the bearing structures clearly visible. Player has to place various type of explosives into the buildings with a minimal amount of detonation wire and blast caps used. The nearby structures are protected with dampers. Although the physics engine is very simple and has some obvious flaws that lead to physically impossible situations at times, the game is very versatile as there often isn"t one clear way of detonating a building in an optimal way.

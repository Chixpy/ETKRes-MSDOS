Maybe you remember the old dos game Lemmings, in which you had to guide those cute lemmings through very hard levels.

Well... they might have looked cute and dumb at the time, but they are back! And this time they are serious.. a war broke out in Lemmings-land. Choose sides, and fight their war!

Lemmings At War is the ultimate combination of Worms and Lemmings. It is a 2-player game!

This game is FREE. this means you can copy it and spread it around as many as you like, without changing the contents of the game.

Stars of television and cinema, and now stars of their own video game. Join Moe, Larry & Curly (in no particular order) who must collect $5000 to try and save an orphanage and the young children who live there from the evil banker, all while keeping pie out of their face. Featuring platform level designs based on classic Stooge scenes from their many TV episodes and movies and level objectives re-living many of their antics plus original Stooge voices and Stooge trivia.

The digitized voices and pictures used in this game come from real Three Stooges shorts.

On the PC, The Three Stooges was much more enjoyable on the Tandy/PCjr series over the traditional PC and clones because the sound chip was utilized quite well. Not only was it used for 3-voice music and sound effects, but for the digitized speech as well. This enabled the sound of Larry, Moe, and Curly to come through much clearer than through the conventional PC speaker.

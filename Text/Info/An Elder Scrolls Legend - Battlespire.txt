An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire is a spin-off to the main Elder Scrolls series and offers a more linear and action-oriented approach than its predecessors. Battlespire is a training ground to become an Imperial Battlemage. When the protagonist enters, the place has been taken over by a Daedra Prince and needs to be saved.

The game consists of multiple expansive levels which all offer their own theme and background stories which are learned by talking to people in multiple choice dialogues. There is still the same role-playing character system as in Daggerfall, but there are no towns, no gold, and all your items are acquired by finding them (either on the ground or on dead bodies). The weapons consist of the basic medieval RPG implements. This game also supports multiplayer, allowing players to battle it out with friends and other guilds.

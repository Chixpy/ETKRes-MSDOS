Backgammon, Poker, and Blackjack are very early PC versions of popular parlor/casino games, published by ShareData in the mid-80s.There is not much I can say about these games, except that they are pretty decent titles by 1987 standards, with non-existent but serviceable ASCII-only "graphics" and concise on-line rules of each game. In this day and age, all these games seem horribly dated, and even in their time they were far from the best available. IBM"s Backgammon, for example, features nice CGA graphics and many more play options - even though it was released 3 years before ShareData"s game. Poker is probably the best game of this bunch, but that is not saying much either. Worth a look as early pioneers of PC gaming history, but not recommended to anyone who actually want to play them ;)

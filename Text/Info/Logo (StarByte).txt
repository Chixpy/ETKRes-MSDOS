Logo is a collection of three fairly simple puzzle games in one pack.All three games are variant of a traditional matching game, except that after solving one level, you get to see one piece of a supposedly erotic picture... duh. It"s strange that StarByte would make a mature game, although none of the erotic pictures would dethrone the awful Strip Poker series as the champion of cheap, gaudy mature games. Pretty tasteless, I must say. 

Note: The manual is in German, though the rules for the three games are simple and you should be able to learn them without the manual. Press F1 or F2 to start the game in one or two player mode.

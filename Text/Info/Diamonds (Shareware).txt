This interesting puzzle game is similar to another game I"ve played ... I just can"t think of what that game is. The object is to guide your bouncing ball around the levels, changing your active color by touching key blocks, and breaking blocks that are the same color as the last "key block" you touched. (It makes sense when you start playing.) Average graphics, but fun gameplay.

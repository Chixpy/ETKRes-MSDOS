It is the year 2117.  The planet Tralfaz  has been  taken over  by th evil ex-hooker Madame Ching.  

Yer a member of the Resistance.  When Ching captures you, she sentences you to the Dungeon of Ecstacy.
   
Don"t get all jazzed up: the Dungeon of Ecstacy is not as great  as it sounds.  The Dungeon is the central  Whorehouse of the Junta  of Tralfaz, and it exists for their pleasure.  BUT, when  someone  is convicted  of a crime against the State, they are injected with pheromones and  let loose in the locked building.  If they are unable to find the necessary keys to get out, they die of sexual tension.  If they do get out, they are free.

So  you  have  to  run  around, grabbing keys and condoms and screwing girls when yer sexual tension gets too high.  It"s rough; real rough.

"Hello game lovers ! Here"s the last shareware game from the two Nice Guys. Remember those school days when some boring teacher would be lecturing boring stuff... What was there to do ? There where no IBMs... Well, the two Nice Guys would pick up a piece of paper, draw a figure (like a house), and would try to redraw it by lifting the pen from the paper a minimum number of times. That"s what Tracer is all about!

Every time you lift the pen, you have made a ""trace"". Like in a golf game, every figure has a par, that is the average number of times that one is
allowed to lift the pen to trace.

For example, we can draw the stair figure in five traces. If we draw it in four, we get a score of -1, in six of +1, and in five, we are even. So actually, in this game, having a negative score is great!"

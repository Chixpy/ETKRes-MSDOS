A strategy game - your aim is to get to the far end of a large grid, filled with enemies, holes and walls. You have the ability to create and fill in holes, to stop the enemies reaching you or to reach new areas. The enemies vary in intelligence - some will just move towards you, while others will move around walls to reach you. The further forward you move, the more points you gain; if you have to backtrack you"ll lose them again.

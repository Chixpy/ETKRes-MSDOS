Ahib was a vengeful, yet funny sheik, in search for oil. Things were going fine and dandy, until a stranger named Lakum came and tried to cheat Ahib"s oil from him. That didn"t work, and Lakum was chased away. He was angry, because Ahib has treated him that way, and went out to steal his oil, and of course settle the score with Ahib.

Ahib"s only weapon is his old, wooden pickaxe, which he has used quite a bit in his search. Can Ahib defeat Lakum? Can he build up his own oil kingdom? Let"s hope so.

The Oil Adventure is a game of mazes. Collect all the oil on a level to complete it, and find treasures and power-ups to aid your quest. Find keys to locked doors, which may help or hinder you in completing. Ahib can wreck some types of walls using his pickaxe. Dig out secret oil leads and other secret things.

Crash your way through 100 oily levels. Chase Lakum out of your great oil fields! Find good treasures and secret oil leads! Much to discover!

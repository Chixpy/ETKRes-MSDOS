Da started from the combination of two ideas. The first was of course Tetris which is put out by Spectrum Holobyte. In Tetris, blocks fall and you rotate them, move them left and right and eventually drop them into the pit. Rows disappear when you completed one all the way across the width of the pit. You lose when the blocks in the pit reach to the top. The second part of Da is Columns which was written by Jay Geertsen and Nathan Meyers. In Columns, blocks three high and one wide fall and you move them left and right. Each part of the block is a different color (3 in all) and you rotate through the colors. When the piece is dropped to the bottom of the pit if three or more of the same color matched up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally those pieces disappeared. Da is a combination of these two games. Using Tetris pieces and colors like Columns Da allows pieces to fall out of the pit by rows or by matching colors. Tetris and Columns both had major limitations which Da does not. First of all the pit size was always the same which gave the game no variety. In Da the put size may be changed from 4 \u00d7 4 to 38 \u00d7 24. Second, the block in Columns was always the same and Tetris only had seven blocks in all. Da has twenty-six different blocks. Some of these blocks go far beyond standard looking Tetris pieces and make the game extremely challenging. The advanced blocks can be turned on or off using a menu option. Finally, neither Tetris nor Columns allowed for competition between two players. Da is a one or two player game in which the pit size can vary between 4 \u00d7 4 to 18 \u00d7 23. I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed writting it.

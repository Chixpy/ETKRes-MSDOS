Troy is a simple sidescrolling/jumping game that seems more suited to kids or younger game players. It features pretty good VGA graphics and solid gameplay, but it frankly isn"t very exciting. If you have young children in your home, this may be a good game for them to play, since it also features a cure dinosaur-like lead character ("Troy").

Czech space shooter that offers as many enemies and changing environment, animated intro, lots of fun, action and actually everything has the right to have a space shooter. Who can still remember a similar game from osmibit\u016f, so definitely try this sort of thing.
So this was for its time, really hilarious Czech gameska. It was founded in the mid nineties and its author Ladislav Toma\u0161t√≠k, author of many vyveden\u00fdch Czech freeware gamesek for both Dos and Windows. 

This time it is a space shooter in the style osmibitov\u00fdch gamesek and your task will be nothing more than to control the spacecraft as it destroy all obstacles that stand in your way - so all enemy ships, spaceships and enemy objects. 

You"ll be pleased for his time at freewarovek unprecedented animated intro and changing backgrounds, enemies and nice graphics reminiscent of the good old, but already faded times osmibitov\u00fdch equipment.

Captain Bible in the Dome of Darkness is a Christian game released in 1994, by Bridgestone. A limited version named Captain Bible: Special Edition was released for free shortly afterwards.

Using the Sword of the Spirit, the Shield of Faith and the power of the Holy Word we are tasked with helping our hero, Captain Bible in defeating the evil "cybers" who have invaded and incased a innocent human city. The main gameplay feature consists of finding the lost verses from the Bible, which you can find scattered in the city, and can be used to defeat your enemies.

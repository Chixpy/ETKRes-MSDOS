Tetris on the futuristic (mainly, but not only subject), where, first, each level has a certain conditional plot justification (for example, to fill the spacecraft energy), unusual (and always different) design pieces that are falling from the top (forget "boring" blocks and get ready for the most real pretzels!), and indeed a very original and beautiful design levels. On the other hand - in spite of a schedule as it is, this game is not very original thing: after all, in fact it is just another version of Tetris, which will be of interest primarily to fans of the various "ideas" on the subject.

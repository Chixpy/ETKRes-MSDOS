Final Orbit is a top-down giant robot action game. You pilot an egg-shaped robot, shooting everything in sight on each level.In the first three levels of this game, you man a walker. Once inside the main complex, however, you are strippeddown to your combat armor and your basic weapon. More powerful weapons can be picked up along the way and those weapons can be made more powerful when picking up another weapon by hitting the trash creatures on the screen.

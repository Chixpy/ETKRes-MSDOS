Arguably boasting the most intriguing premise of any Paul Panks game, Ghost of the Fireflies sees the player initially directing the actions of Camphora, a phantom beetle, through the environs of Atsuta Jing\u016b... plotting revenge against Sugawara no Michizane for reasons not initially clear.  Navigating this tricky scenario is achieved with the assistance of Raiythius, a sassy Zen hellhound sidekick with a penchant for conveying enlightenment through physical pain and micturition.

While the setting of this text adventure is quite explicitly and thoroughly Japanese, the game boasts even stranger cameo appearances than previous Panks games, including a suffering Jesus of Nazareth at the start screen, Bruce Lee as the shopkeeper (with Mr. Miyagi in the eaves) and founding father Ben Franklin, murdered for cheating in a gambling game with Wyatt Earp and his posse at the Oibara Inn.  All this plus the game"s author himself (hinting at some bizarre post-modern denouement) as the frontman for the house band the Singing Nobunagas!

The gameplay is largely a matter of roving between areas picking up that which is not nailed down and killing that which can be overcome through physical combat (but now nearly featuring -- see trivia -- an alchemical magic system of sorts).

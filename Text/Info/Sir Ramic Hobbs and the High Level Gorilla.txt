The first adventure of Sir Ramic Hobbs: knight drunkard and dimwit. Although Hobbs is contractually bound to rescue a pricess from an enormous gorilla the goal of this game is simply to get home safely. Makes interesting use of the narrative voice: the text of the game is spoken by a disembodied wizard who accompanies and advises Hobbs. Full of insult jokes names based on strained puns and absurd and anachronistic objects (notably an ancient Chinese steam locomotive). Somewhat linear with several points where you can"t go back to retrieve items left behind. Makes frequent use of the verb USE. Hints are available in most rooms via the help command. -- Carl Muckenhoupt

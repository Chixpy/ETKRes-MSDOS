Although sounding similar to Snafu and hanging onto the element of a growing wall from that game Gnafu is more akin to Snake type games. In this unlicensed clone, of the original C64 game by Hebdogiciel, you play a caterpillar that lives in an enclosed garden. In the garden are mushrooms and cherries. You must eat all the cherries that cause you to grow in length while avoiding the mushrooms and walls. If you hit either of those you will lose a life and eventually the game will be over. If you manage to eat all the cherries on the screen you will move on to another randomly generated level. High scores gained are displayed once the game is finished.

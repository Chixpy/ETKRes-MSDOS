"Bert"s Coloring Programs are enjoyable coloring programs for children of all ages, but are especially useful for introducing young children to the computer. Bert"s Coloring Programs were designed by educators to be used by young children with a minimum of assistance by adults. Bert"s Coloring Program series is superior to many other children"s coloring programs in that it allows the user to place the various images, all in four different sizes, on a variety of backgrounds. This allows children to easily create their own picture before coloring. The opportunity to create their own picture will allow children to take pride in their unique creation. Bert"s Coloring Programs also have a voice feature, which can be turned on or off, allowing the images to speak their names, much to the delight of children."

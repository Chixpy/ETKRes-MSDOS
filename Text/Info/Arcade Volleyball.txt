Arcade Volleyball is a simple, 2-player (human or computer) "volleyball"-like game where you have to, simply enough, bang the ball so that it hits the opposite player"s ground. Some basic rules apply: when the ball"s current owner loses a round (either because the ball touched the ground or he touched it for 3 times) the opposite player becomes the owner. If a player is not the owner of the ball and loses a round, the opposite player gains a point. The game is over when either player reaches 15 points.

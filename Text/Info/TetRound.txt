TetRound is a game that is very similar to a famous classical Tetris. In the classical Tetris falling figures are to be placed in a rectangular well. In the TetRound they are to be placed around a cylindrical tube. Filled lines will be removed. The more lines are removed at once the less is increasing of the speed of the game. The game is over when there is no place for new figures. You can rotate the tube and figures to obtain the goal. Use left and right arrow keys to rotate the tube (also you can click the left button of the mouse, when the mouse"s cursor looks like left and right arrow), 5 and up arrow keys to rotate the figure (also you can click the right button of the mouse) and Space or down arrow keys to drop the figure down (also you can click the left button of the mouse, when the mouse"s cursor looks like down arrow). You can press S to play without sound. If there is a CD-ROM drive in your computer you can play CD during playing a game by pressing C to start/stop playing CD and +/- to go to another track.

(In)famous for jokes about it, the Polish city of W\u0105chock is the place where the story of the Polish adventure game So\u0142tys takes place.

You play the head of the village of W\u0105chock and your aim is to find the missing husband of your daughter (who apparently isn"t very attractive if you know what I mean). Scared of his future, Leon decides to run away from the wedding and you are responsible for bringing this poor guy back.

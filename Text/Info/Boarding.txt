Boarding is the first ever snowboarding game in QBasic. The game play was made to resemble a old favorite "Ski Free" made by microsoft in 1992. Boarding differs from ski free in as many ways as it resembles it. First, no monster at the end, sowwy. Boarding also uses real time physics to make the speed of the boarder accurate. The boarder also has a trail behind him left from his snowboard. Also, a plus is the mod sound we added in :). The similarities are the scoring system and tricks.

The license in this game is for famous player Joe Montana, but not for the NFL itself, so the teams represent cities rather than real-world teams, and the roster of players is fictional, although they can be fully edited.

All the major rules of major league football are intact. The action is viewed from the side, with the ability to catch and tackle while on the move. A ReceiverCam to help you find a free man to pass to. Multi-angle replays are built in, and can be saved to disk for a Highlights reel. This game features a playbook that lets you edit and save plays and use them during the game.

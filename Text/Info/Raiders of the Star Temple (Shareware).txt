You recently read an article concerning the possible existence of a lost Mayan temple somewhere near Chichen Itza on the Yucatan Peninsula.  And you have heard an Indian legend which tells of a Star Temple containing a fabulous treasure of diamonds.  You are resolved to find this temple, if it truly exists.

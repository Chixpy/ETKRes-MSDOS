A pushing puzzle game, where you must collect various "bad" things (drugs, needles, etc.) and get to the exit within a certain number of moves. The graphics are fairly average MCGA fare, and there"s no sound effects, but it could be enjoyable nonetheless. (Note: The game has a strong anti-drug message.)

Bram Stoker"s Dracula is the title given to a number of games based on the 1992 film of the same name.  Gameplay for each game varies greatly from platform to platform, but they all retain a similar plot based on the movie. You control a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula"s capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.

The DOS version is an adventure game played from a first person perspective.

First there was darkness, and then the light came. The light of the Demon"s Orb. Asmodeus smiled darkly. "I have created you, and you shall serve me ...," he mumbled. The Orb flared for a second, then dimmed. "I shall rule Hades, then the Earth, then ... the Universe!". Guttural laughter echoed throughout the chamber.

You are briefed by the High Council. The Elder Khartask approaches. "Needless to say, you know all about the Asmodeus problem. He and his Orb pose a great threat to the Universe itself.We at least know that he resides on the Third Level of Hades. It"s not much, but at least you"ll know where to find him. We can"t give you much to go on, but just remember, you are the world"s only hope. Seek and destroy."

Thus the Quest For The Orb begins. Descend into Hades to confront Asmodeus himself, and destroy utterly the Evil Demon"s Orb.

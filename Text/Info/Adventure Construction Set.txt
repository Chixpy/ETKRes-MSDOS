As its name implies, Adventure Construction Set is a program that allows you to create your own "adventure." The result is really an RPG, due to heavy emphasis on monsters and statistics.As a tool for creating dungeons, ACS was very advanced for its time. Though the graphics and sound are simple, there is a lot of room for customization. In addition to a myriad of design choices, the program offers a "create random adventure" feature that is perfect for everyone with limited patience. Once an adventure is created, you can create a "stand-alone" executable to give out to your friends. Overall, a solid, versatile package that is well worth a look if you like top-down RPGs. Too bad the dated graphics don"t stand up too well with time, though-- anyone for a muted-EGA dungeon romp? :)

This is a pretty cool action game that reminds me a bit of the old tabletop game "Crossfire" where the object was to knock a ball into your opponent"s net by firing little metal ball bearings at it. This game is quite fun. It"s colorful and has good sound effects. You can play against the computer (with variable difficulty settings) or you can play a two player game against an opponent. (Note: This is a DOS game, but the install program requires Windows. :/ Sorry!)

An excellent adventure game featuring pixel-based moving and scrolling (Zelda style). Not a typical point & click adventure game, though a mouse is necessary when using objects and few other tasks. The graphics are good, but there are many places/tiles that could have been done better. During the game night and day exchange which is very cool. Many locations and puzzles and a funny story. Good story development. Recommended! Only background MIDI music is supported. This version does not feature the entire game (all locations), but it was released as a complete game and the user supposed to download the missing part of the game sometime near in the future (I failed to find their site on the net). Have in mind this was said in 1999 so I doubt the missing part was ever completed.

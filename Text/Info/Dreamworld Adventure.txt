Almost indie-game from German developer (but with support for English). No particular story, we have to play for some strange creature in a purple ball on two thin legs. meaning of the game is no different than almost any other platformer: you consistently pass the levels (of which there where more than a hundred), trying to collect as many bonus and do not fall into the trap and avoiding enemies and falling. One level includes one screen (but often with the ability to scrolling"a that is instantly see the entire level is not always possible) to pass will need to make a lot of jumps and sprints on dangerous terrain. Enemies are slow and impossibly funny creatures, like crabs and mussels, to deal with them is possible only if there is an opportunity to jump on them (if they bend down and freeze in place, not moving more), no blood and violence in the game. There is also a trap (for example, flimsy platform, under which the fire is burning) and just fall risk with a narrow beam, which immediately terminates death. Naturally, the hero of a few lives. Graphically the game looks great for a "budget" thing - clear and bright hand-drawn graphics reminiscent of the best games from the Amiga, in addition, it is simply amazing music. In short, another little-known criminal and a very rare thing, returning now to the players who just can not help but look and feel of the real fans of the old platformer.

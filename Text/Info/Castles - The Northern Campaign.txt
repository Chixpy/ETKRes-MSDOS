The Celts have been defeated and you"ve built a succession of castles across the wilds of Albion. But still there is no peace. The Picts are rebelling against you in the north and now you must build more castles to defend Albion from these wild savages.

The Northern Campaign is the first campaign disk for Castles, and it includes many new features, such as new graphics, economics, new combat features (vikings, archers etc). and troop training. The Northern Campaign needs the original Castles, it can not be played by itself.

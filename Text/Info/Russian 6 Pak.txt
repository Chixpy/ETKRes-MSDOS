Ever heard of Tetris? There are many other puzzle-based games from Russia and the Russian 6 Pak presents six of them:

Flying Pictures: There is a game field with a lot of blocks with different pictures on it. Your character has also blocks with pictures with him. The goal is to throw every block on another block with a corresponding picture. This block disappears and the block you threw is returned to you with a new picture on it.
Fast Ring: Similar to Pipemania.
Line Man: Also very similar to Pipemania.
Master of Bombs: A Tetris variant with bombs.
Crete: This is a sliding puzzle - slide the walls of the labyrinths so that your avatar can pass through without crossing the path of his enemy. There are no arcade elements present.
Shadows: Shoot asteroids with a crosshair cursor. Pure arcade gameplay in this one.

Besides the separate high score lists for each of the six games there is also another list which takes track of your overall performance.

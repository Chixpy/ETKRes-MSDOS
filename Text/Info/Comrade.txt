The basic object of the game is to fit the falling pieces together so as to leave no spaces.  When a row becomes filled with squares it is removed from the stack of pieces.  The faster a piece is moving the more valuable it is and it loses a point for every time it moves down a row when it is falling, pressing the space bar or the "2" on the number pad will cause the piece to fall to the bottom of the screen  with no points being deducted.  When the piece comes to rest on top of another piece it can still be moved until the next piece is generated.  The speed is based on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the fastest.  Use the number pad left right arrow keys for moving the piece left or right.  The "8" key speeds the piece up and the "7" slows it down.  You move up a level when you"ve filled 15 rows.

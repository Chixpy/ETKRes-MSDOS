An alien vessel had approached earth along an elliptical orbit, at first mistaken for a comet, and launched pods at the surface. These pods disembarked giant alien robots which then carved out a path of destruction, attacking cities and removing life. In desperation, the world unleashed it"s nuclear arsenal to stop the robots, in the process adding to the devastation. The broken remains of humanity gathered the pieces of the destroyed robot invaders and learned enough of it"s manufacturing and design to copy the designs and build their own. Manufacturing their own armies, they prepare to repel an anticipated invasion that will come with the alien vessel"s second pass....

Ultrabots is a single player first person robot simulation game. The player sits in the cockpit of one of the robotic fighter and is able to attack with weapons specific to that model. The player can instantly switch his location between any robot currently in play via a strategy map. There are three different models of these robotic assault machines. The Humanoid model is the main fighting model and average speed, The Scorpion model is slow, has a powerful stinger tail weapon and can lay down or dismantle the power grid. The Scout model is the fastest type but has light weaponry. These robots only operate within a certain proximity of the "power grid" and function only on a limited amount of battery power when leaving it"s proximity. The power grid can only be extended through use of the Scorpion robot which should be protected due to it"s slow speed and vulnerability. Each damaged robot can be repaired at the player"s base after a short delay. Success on each map comes when one side is able to reach the enemy"s base and destroy it, halting any further production.

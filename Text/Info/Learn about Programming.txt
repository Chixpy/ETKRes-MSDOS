Learn about Programming is yet another excellent entry in Compedia"s long line of "Top Class" edutainment titles.As the title suggests, this little program teaches the basics of programming in concise multimedia lectures and fun multiple-choice quizzes. The graphics are crisp, the topic interesting, and the difficulty level is just right for kids of all ages (though I would say anyone younger than 12 might have a tough time understanding some of the concepts). If you have even a passing interest in computer programming, this is one underdog that will keep you entertain - and teach you enough programming basics for you to start coding BASIC programs. Two thumbs up!

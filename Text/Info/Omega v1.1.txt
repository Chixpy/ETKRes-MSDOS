The idea of the game is simple; shoot everything you see. 

With mouse:

You pilot the space ship with mouse by turning it  (move the mouse horizontally) what ever the direction you want to move (left button) or shoot (right button).

With keyboard (the numeric keypad):

  key "4" : counterclockwise
  key "6" : clockwise
  key "8" : moving forward
  and
  "space" : firing

Scoring is also simple; a slow alien 100 points and a fast one 300 points. Once you"ve played the game, you"ll see which are the slow ones and which are the fast ones.

Also clearing (is that a suitable word, don"t know) the level gives you some bonus points, depending on how little ammunition you have used.

When you have cleared the level (5 aliens) you"ll be "transmitted" to the next one. Every third level gains you one more ship.

Block-O-Mania is a turn-based puzzle game with a variety of puzzles with an overall high difficulty level. Like in Soko-Ban, the player has to push a number of boxes onto storage spots. This time however, there are four kinds of blocks, plus conveyors, unstable passages, and wraparound screens. It contains several dozen mind-benders for the true puzzle aficionado.

The game was originally released as shareware on the BBS scene. With the advent of the Internet, it was eventually released as freeware on the web.

"In a distant, far off galaxy, there lived a man named Don. Don was a Space Cadet who dreamed about being an ace StarFighter, but alas, he was too young.

One day, then planet of Kwendor was taken over by Daiwn, the king of Galia. Daiwn was an evil ruler and was not satisfied in his conquest, so he kidnapped Don"s niece. Nobody dared join in Don"s quest to recuse his niece. Not even his brother.

So begins the game where you help to get Don to the evil mini-men-in-the-moon who are Daiwn"s top guardians on Kwendor. Good luck, and may the force be with you! "

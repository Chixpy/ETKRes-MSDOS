Absolute Pinball is a pinball game which features four tables with different themes: Desert Run (car tour from Paris to Dakar), Aquatic Adventure (treasure hunt at a beach), The Dream Factory (Hollywood) and Balls "n Bats (Baseball). All tables feature three flippers and several mini games on the scoreboard, e.g. swimming away from sharks. Also worth mentioning are the five graphics mode which range from a classic scrolling table to a transverse view which shows the whole table at one. The controls follow the genre standard.

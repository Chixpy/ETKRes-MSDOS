In this game the player controls Werner Mueller, working as a Sysop at the GIC Headqurters in Futura City. One night, heavy explosions wake him unpleasantly from his sleep. He steps outside to see what happened, only to find himself in the middle of a deadly fight...

Angst: Rhaz"s Revenge is a traditional first-person-shooter in the legacy of DOOM: the player walks through the levels and uses ranged weapons to shoot at enemies. The game has a steampunk setting in the style of Jules Verne.

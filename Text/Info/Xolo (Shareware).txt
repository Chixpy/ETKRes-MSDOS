I like this game! You fly your little ship around the screen (Asteroid-like physics are used) but instead of blasting asteroids, you attack one ship which sits in the middle of the screen, and is guarded by shields. It sounds dumb, but it"s actually quite fun, and it gets tougher quickly. Nice graphics and sound, too.

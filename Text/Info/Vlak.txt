Vlak (translated as Train from Czech) is a freeware 90"s clone of Snake. You control a train to collect items scattered around an area while avoiding to crash into something. Every time you obtain a new item, your train will have a new wagon attached to it. The wagons differ in looks based on what kind of item you pick up. The pickups include animals, crowns, diamonds, plants and apples. When you collect all the items, you can exit through a yellow door to advance to a new and even more complicated room. There is an unlimited amount of continues and no highscore, but there are 50 levels while the program weighs only 13 KB.

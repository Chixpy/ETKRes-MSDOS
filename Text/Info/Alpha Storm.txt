Alpha Storm is a spaceship simulator and a first person shooter. You can travel through star systems. Encounter enemy fleets and battle them with the ship"s weapons/devices, or by shooting the enemy ships shields down and teleporting there to kill the crew by your own.

You can equip the ship with different lasers, radars, radar jammers, engines or cloaks each with many different power levels. Alternatively, you can combine them with yourself making you a better killing machine. The player is equipped with different types of PSI-abilities and weapons.

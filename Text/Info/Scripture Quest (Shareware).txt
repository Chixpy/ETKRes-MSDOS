Scripture Quest is a game that in actuality involves no questing. It"s a Bible quiz game that contains over 1,600 multiple choice questions about history"s most influential text. You can choose questions from the Old Testament, New Testament, or both, and include 1-9 players taking turns on the keyboard. The presentation is quite basic (text-mode with no graphics) but it does present some interesting questions. The questions vary in difficulty from easy to obscure and unfortunately there"s no difficulty selection. Other than that, it"s a solid game/quiz program.

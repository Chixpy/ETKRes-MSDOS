Rare Spanish action in the first person, the gameplay and graphics, the former for its release (1998), probably already an anachronism for some finicky, however in terms of oldgeymera very exciting, fun and an "eternal for all time." What I liked Osarium most - so the fact that there are no large-scale plot, which would have had to deal at least for decency. The action takes place in the distant future, in which all the bad character - a super-soldier, fighting with monsters. Actually, except for the rarity and the Spanish language, which in this game looks strange (though there is not enough text - the menu and some small posts along game), Osarium little different from other games of the genre of the mid-90"s. Not much different from the other levels, several types of monsters and weapons (by the way, is quite interesting), level graphics "better Doom , but worse Duke ". So, in other words - quite ordinary, but this is not losing the charm and appeal of FPS. Due to his immense rarity, he will certainly be a great discovery for the many fans of shooters, longing for the "good old" pieces of the genre.

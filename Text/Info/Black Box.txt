In Black Box there is an 8x8 grid which contains several atoms hidden in it. Your job is to find the location of all of the atoms by projecting rays from the side of the box and observing what happens. If a ray directly hits an atom it will be absorbed. Rays that pass within one box of an atom will be reflected. After you have fired enough rays, you can venture a guess as to an atoms location. To help prevent random guessing you lose points for a ray that completely misses an atom or an incorrect guess about the atoms location, and gain points for rays that are absorbed or reflected and for a correct guess. If you get stumped you can end the game early and peek at the location of all atoms.

Black Box is a great PC version of a 1978 Parker Brothers board game of the same name that emphasizes logical deduction.Sort of a 3D version of Mastermind, your goal in this game is to find hidden balls in a ?black box? by shooting light rays into it. Since the crystal balls reflect shots, you need to observe where your shots leave the box (or whether they don?t) to deduce the balls? locations. The challenge is to correctly deduce the locations with the least number of light rays. 

This freeware PC version by Michael Haugrud offers dozens of levels of fun with an intuitive player interface. If you enjoy logical puzzles that require no reflexes to solve, Black Box will entertain you for hours on end, even if the gameplay is a little repetitive. Thumbs up!

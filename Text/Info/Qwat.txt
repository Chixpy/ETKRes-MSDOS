You might be asking yourself Qwat the heck is Qwat? Well, I"ll tell you, it"s a great Tetris-a-like. No bombs, no added stuff. Just Tetris with four kitty murals to discover as you do well. If you make two rows of blocks go away a peice of the picture gets uncovered! As I said there are four whole colomns of pictures, so just because you cleared one screen doesn"t mean your the master.

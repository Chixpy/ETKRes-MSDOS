This short text adventure (written in a mere 181 lines of BASIC code) has the player exploring a vampire"s lair in search of the game"s "concealed goal."  Not surprisingly, room descriptions are extremely terse and there aren"t a whole lot of actions to perform.  The parser accepts two-word commands (though it only looks at the first three letters of any given word) and has a vocabulary of about seventy words.

This is a slightly buggy and extremely silly adventure game I wrote in my spare time long long ago (about 4.32 years, when I was young and foolish and not even nineteen yet). I thought some people might find it amusing. It"s playable, but not quite complete, i.e. could use some fleshing out here and there, particularly in a couple of spots where the player is killed without any warning whatsoever. It requires some background info to play.

You are cast into the role of sophomore saxophonist in the Digby Corners High School Marching Band. DCHS has a good band, individual-talent-wise, though the marching band as a whole is decidedly second rate. However, your director, Mr. Norman Redchipp, has put his foot in his mouth in a big way: he has claimed that if DCHS fails to beat its rival Crountain Mest High in the upcoming 1982 Douglas Cup marching band competition, he will personally buy pizza for the entire CMHS band. Such a claim would be written-off if it were merely bravado practised in his own band room, but he happened to mention it to the CMHS band director, Ms. Mary Shanning. And she"ll hold him to it if DCHS loses. And Crountain Mest has won the Douglas Cup every year since Mary Shanning took the reins....

You are to collect diamonds avoiding falling stones and
creatures trying to catch you. The number of diamonds you
must collect is written at the bottom line of the screen.
Often there are less diamonds than you need. In such case
you should throw down the stone while a creature is under
it. It will change into the diamond.

There are two levels of this game (for novices and normal).
To change level press "C" key (in menu). The second level
is much more interesting, because it"s plan is"n random
(like at the first level) - try it, you will convince
yourself. This level is also a bit more difficult - you
must collect ALL diamonds.

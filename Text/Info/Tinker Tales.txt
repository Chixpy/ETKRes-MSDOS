One of the earliest "interactive storybook" for kids, Tinker Tales is an excellent title designed for young readers.The program contains 3 different stories, all centered around a young girl. The stories come complete with attractive pictures (albeit in CGA only) and good music. 

The gameplay is simple: press SPACEBAR to advance the story, and choose your action from multiple choices from time to time. This makes the game similar to choose-your-own-adventure books, which means it has a very high replayability. Kids will have fun returning to the program to see where the different choices lead to. The stories are well-written and quite interesting -- these are not your average Cinderella type of fairy tales. Definitely well worth a look, especially for its historical value ;) Two thumbs up, way up!

An average RPG whose strongest sides are its gameplay and length (size). Pixel-based movement. Turn-based battles. The Wrath Of Sona features very unbalanced quality of the graphics (from horrible to very good) and overall it"s poorly designed. The game is accompanied with nice background music tracks. Many places, characters and events in this game don"t sit well with me, seem out of place or don"t make logic. I guess if you are into turn-based RPGs you might like The Wrath Of Sona. The author of this game doesn"t consider it finished.

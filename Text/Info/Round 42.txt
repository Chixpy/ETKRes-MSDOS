A traditional space shooter involving 42 rounds of battle against invading alien ships (hence the name).  Each round of aliens has different movement and firing patterns.  

Against such odds, you are provided with two weapons:  An auto-fire cannon, and a single-fire targeting laser.  Extra ships and shots for the targeting laser are earned one per successful completion of a round (the auto-fire cannon has unlimited ammo).

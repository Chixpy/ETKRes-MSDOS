The game is actually quite simple to play. There are two players who alternate placing their stones on the board. There are three modes: a) two players, b) one player against the computer and c) computer against computer. There are two ways to win. First, you may win by placing five or more of your stones in a straight row. The row may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. (Like winning at Tick Tack Toe but with five pieces instead of three.) Second, you may win by capturing five of your opponent"s pairs of stones. You capture a pair by enclosing them with two of your stones, one at each end. You may capture more than one pair at a time. Always make your first move in the middle of the board as indicated by the mark. That"s all there is to it. Of course you must defend yourself from being attacked in the same way.

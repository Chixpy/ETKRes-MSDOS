Star Trek Chesepeake is a Star Trek RPG currently in progress. 
Here are a few screenshots for now as well as a really short demo.

An RPG (role playing game) where Commander Ryan Ramses has been ordered to take the USS Chesepeake ito the Klingon, Romulan & Federation border to investigate a recently created anomaly. DOS, suitable for Windows (including XP).

Of course, this is no ordinary science mission...

Star Trek Chesepeake ("Chesepeake" has an "e" not an "a") is described by the author as a "demo" but it is quite extensive and offers a lot of good role playing.

Being a DOS program the graphics are quite basic but the game is still very playable and, while it does lack the fancy graphics we expect through Windows, you soon forget the graphics and concentrate on the game.

The Alt key brings up a menu that allows you to see what items you have, as well as control other aspects of the game (including Quit). The Volume control did not work for us and we assume that sound was not added to this game.

We played it under Windows XP without needing to set the compatibility. The game plays in fullscreen mode.

If you are a fan of Star Trek, or just a lover of RPG games, Star Trek Chesepeake is worth grabbing.

Try it yourself!

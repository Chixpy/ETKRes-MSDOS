Electron Havoc is a two player strategy game which is similar to the classic Bananas (of QBasic fame) or Scorched Earthy style game. The object is to destroy your opponent by setting your gun location & velocity. The main difference here is that your shots are affected by the gravitational pull of planets in space so you must carefully plan your shots accordingly. The presentation here is quite basic but it does work as intended for those looking for this sort of game.

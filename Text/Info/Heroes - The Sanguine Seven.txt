A jail break has occurred in the city of Megatropolis and five evil supervillains have escaped! The city"s last resort is to summon a team of superheroes, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities. The gameplay is similar to the old Apogee EGA titles, like Duke Nukem and Cosmo"s Cosmic Adventure: Forbidden Planet.

There"s a grand total of 50 levels to play and 7 characters to choose. Gems can be collected in the levels to upgrade characters" stats, and fruit can be collected to increase your health.

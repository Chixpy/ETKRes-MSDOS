One of the first "realistic" pool games for the PC, PC Pool Challenges lets you play straight pool or 8 ball with up to 4 players in an incredibly customizable simulation.Description from MobyGames: "Players can be human or computer controlled. Nearly every aspect of pool is re-created in this game including speed, english, skill levels and more. The game also has a customize menu allowing you to change friction, rail bounce, collide accuracy and much much more." 

PC Pool Challenges is an astounding programming feat for its time (1984), and a game that, surprisingly enough, stands the test of time amazingly well almost two decades later. Two thumbs up, way up!

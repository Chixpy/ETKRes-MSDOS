You may have seen cryptograms in puzzle magazines.  Computer Cryptograms is a program that allows you to solve cryptogram without erasing holes through the pages in a puzzle book.  The Shareware demonstration version of Computer Cryptograms comes with 75 cryptograms.  When you run the program, you are prompted to pick a set of cryptograms from the available cryptogram files, they have the file extensions ".CRG"  After selecting a set, the display shows the current cryptogram in a box, the top displays the filename of the current set of cryptograms and the number of the current cryptogram, and the lower portion of the screen shows the unused letters and the key.  The key is stored in the file, so the program and the .CRG files must reside on a non-write protected disk so that they may be updated.  This means you may abandon a cryptogram and try it again later without starting over.

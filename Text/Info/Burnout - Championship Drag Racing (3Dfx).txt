Burnout is racing simulation devoted to the world of drag racing. You fine-tune your car in the hopes of then being able to send it at insanely high speeds in short, linear tracks. And this is what makes the bulk of the game, a dizzing array of customization options are available for you to construct the perfect hot-rod, essentially making it a "grease monkey" simulation.

Additional features include bracket racing (where you select an estimated time based on your practice runs, and try to meet it against other cars), quick race and a complete season against 64 computer controlled cars. Also available is multiplayer racing through modem, LAN or internet.

The graphics engine is a suped-up version of the X-Car engine, and supports 3D acceleration with all sorts of nifty effects such as smoke, sparks, tire distortion, etc.

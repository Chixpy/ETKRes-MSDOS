Probably the rarest game from Windmill Software, maker of Digger, Attack on Altair is a shooter game that is entirely text-based and not a very good one, at that.If you have played Space Invaders and its clones, you know what to expect here. It"s a bit similar to IBM Attack, another very old shooter except here the objective is the much more mundane kill-aliens-to-save-the-galaxy affair. Action takes place on the surface of planet Altair, but without any real graphics it"s just too difficult making out the targets ;) Worth a try just to see what Windmill"s early days are like before you put it down and play the timeless Digger instead.

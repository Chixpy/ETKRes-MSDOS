What a thoroughly delightful day!

Your head is tilted back and you are marveling at the gorgeous, billowing white clouds that are arrayed against a panorama of the most beauitful blue sky you have ever seen.

The clouds are so fantasically formed that you lapse into your old childhood game of imagining shapes and faces on their surfaces.  Look, there"s a piggy; and there"s a ducky; and there"s Uncle Fred; and there"s a Tyrannosaurus Rex locked in mortal combat with Godzilla.

At complete peace with yourself and the universe, you gently lower your head to gaze off at the horizon and discover that it"s not where you expected it to be.  In fact, to your utter astonishment, you notice that the ground is in a rather unusual place... straight ahead.

How blood inconvenient!

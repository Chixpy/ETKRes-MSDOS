"Somewhere in the system of XON (pronounced ""zon""), there is a power crystal which gives the bearer ultimate power. Not many have ever dared to try to find it, however, because a dangerous race of creatures, called the OCTAXON, live there. The OCTAXON are creature who can live anywhere, including space, because they need no oxygen. Hence, anywhere one travels in the system, they are attacked.

PARSEC, however, is a very daring adventurer, out to capture the crystal. PARSEC wears a jetpack suit armed with a powerful energy bolt emmitter that can instantly vaporize one of the OCTAXON. He also has a plasma bolt emmitter, which must be fed power to work.

PARSEC quickly checked a description of the four planets of XON:

XON-1 *** Point of interest: Orbital Asteroids. XON-1 has a dense asteroid belt which no ship can pass through. Readings of a powerful energy source have been found there, as well as the remains of an alien starbase. 

XON-2 *** Point of interest: Surface. XON-2"s surface has the remains of an old alien town. A crystal may be found there. 

XON-3 *** Point of interest: Oribital Station. A starbase was set up to find the power crystal. A crystal was said to be found, but then all life was destroyed in the station and the station fell apart. 

XON-4 *** Point of interest: Caves. A cave was discovered which had zero gravity. The face that the planet is Zero-G indicates the presence of a power source. 

PARSEC knew that there are three duplicate crystals that must be found. These crystals are the only way to unlock a mechanism which is said to keep THE power crystal from being taken.

He was all set. He quickly took off in his jetpack suit to the system of XON, in search of glory... "

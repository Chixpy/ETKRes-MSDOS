The Master of Mischief is planning on making Shady Glen School disappear! He has invented disappearing paint, and turned five paint brushes into robots to paint the school at midnight. The Master of Mischief himself is disguised as a robot, and it is your job to find him. Hidden throughout the school are clues which reveal his whereabouts. Robots are placed in the school to slow your progress, some of which may even contain clues themselves. You carry a camera with you to take a picture and examine dangerous robots closer.

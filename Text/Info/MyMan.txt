The game is relatively faithful to the classic arcade game, except that it uses text graphics as rough approximations of the famous Pacman characters (ex. "C" for Pacman (or "MyMan") and "A"s for the ghosts). It plays decently, though it"s more of a novelty than a game you"d want to play often, since there are other more impressive Pacman-style games available.

Space Pilot is a decent space dogfighting game. The concept is simple: shoot the other ships! ;) The controls are a bit awkward at first (use the Alt/Ctrl keys to rotate and Shift to fire) but aren"t so bad once you get used to them. Average graphics, but the game itself seems pretty well put together. A no-frills shooting game with not much to make it remarkable.

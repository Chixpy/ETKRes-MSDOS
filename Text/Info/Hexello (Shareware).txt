Welcome to Hexello! The game is played much as the classic board game Othello, with the added twist of playing on a hexagonal, rather than square, game field. Players alternate turns placing tiles on the board to capture their opponents" pieces. Opposing pieces are captured when they lie in a line between the piece a player plays and other pieces that player controls, flipping the sandwiched pieces to the opposite color. Pieces must capture pieces with each turn, forfeiting his/her turn legally only when there are no possible captures.

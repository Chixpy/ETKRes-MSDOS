"Usually, tests of knowledge, or trivia games, are not very educational since you don"t learn very much from them. If you know the correct answer, you will get it right. Otherwise, you guess. If you guessed correctly, then you may remember the answer if the same question was asked again. But, do you really understand the reasoning behind the correct answer? Usually not. You probably just got lucky.

Quizzia is different. Quizzia is an educational game. It was developed to add some fun to the learning process. It always gives you more information about the topic you are quizzed on. Whether you get it right or not, there will be an explanation below to promote learning. You can play against friends or against a clock. You can choose to get difficult questions, not so difficult questions, or a mixture. The shareware version
comes with 50 questions about nutrition. The registered version comes with the entire database of over 400 questions about nutrition. Other topics are being developed. Write for more information if you are interested in purchasing them or if you have suggestions for new topics."

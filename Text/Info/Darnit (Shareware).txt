"Welcome to Darnit 11.0! You keep buying it, so we keep improving it! Users familiar with earlier versions can look forward to a host of new features and an exciting new play screen. Newcomers will rejoice at the ease of play and happy fun times to be had all by one"s lonesome.

Solitude and loneliness. For many, these words are synonymous. But here at BSX, solitude is always a good time (none of your damn business, if you must ask!). And now it can be for you too! Just fire up DARNIT 11.0 and there you are. So next time you get stood up for that big disco date, or when all your friends get married, move out of town and can talk about nothing but mortgages and baby clothes, no problem! You can spend some time with BSX and DARNIT 11.0, because we know just what you"re going through. If you can play DARNIT while those about you are getting married and blaming it on you, then, and ONLY then, will you be a cardmeister, YOU BUM!

Listen: only the most neophytical of neophytes will need to pore over these dox. Just start the game and play. Then, if you got a problem, you can bet these dox will help you solve them. Have fun!"

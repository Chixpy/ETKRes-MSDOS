The second Descent game features new levels, new weapons and new robot enemies. It also comes with helpful ideas for the player like the Guide-bot, the ability to fly with afterburner or energy-to-shield converter that many times they become a must!

An extras pack released after the success of Descent II, Vertigo Series adds 23 missions and, as a bonus, provides some of the music tracks from the original Descent II in Redbook Audio format (plays in a regular CD player). It also comes bundled with the Mission Builder II pack. The new missions have added effects not found in the original as well as creative map and enemy design.

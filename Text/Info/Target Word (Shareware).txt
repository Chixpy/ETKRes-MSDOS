TARGET WORD is a word game, with the objective of finding the "target word" that the computer has chosen from a list of words in a data file. The player uses carefully chosen "probe words" and logical analysis to eventually find out the identity of the target word.
          
This game was an original creation of Anatol Holt, and was described in the "Mathematical Games" section of Scientific American, April, 1969.

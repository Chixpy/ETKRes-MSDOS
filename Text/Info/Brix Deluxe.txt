A nearly identical clone of Puzznic, right down to the appearance of the pieces and brick backgrounds. Brix is a challenging and entertaining puzzle game in which you push blocks around the levels and to try get them beside identical blocks to eliminate them. Two or more of the same block will eliminate each other, and all must be eliminated to finish each level. Pushing the pieces will require you to think about how to make a path for them, how to eliminate them in the right order, and how to use gravity and elevators to your advantage while avoiding obstacles like lasers. Author Michael Riedel distributed v1.0, with 112 levels, under the developer name "Radiesel", and the documentation declares the game public domain. 

Version 2.0 added content developed by Epic MegaGames, adding a soundtrack, backgrounds, animation, and other bells and whistles. Many of the levels are recycled, but there a number of new levels with new gameplay elements like barriers that slowly break when a block is on top of them, levels where gravity reverses every time an hourglass runs out of sand, teleporters, and two kinds of acid: one which destroys blocks and counts as elimination, and one that destroys blocks and prevents you from completing the level. Registering the game gives you Brix 2 Deluxe, which adds 112 new levels and a level editor.

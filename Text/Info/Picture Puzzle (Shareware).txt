Picture Puzzle is not just another puzzle program. Picture Puzzle is different in many ways. Because I did not want the difficulty of the puzzle to be dependent on how complex the picture was I thought it would be nice to have you be able to select what size and shape puzzle you would like. So by using the arrow keys you can adjust the number of puzzle pieces from 4 all the way to 1400. When you build a very large puzzle some pictures will have pieces that are identical (i.e. Blue Sky, or Green Grass). Picture Puzzle has the ability to recognize this and will finish the puzzle as soon as you have the picture in a completed form, even if some of the pieces that are the same happen to be mixed. Picture Puzzle also recognizes when you have put a piece beside a piece it belongs next to and removes the grid between them. This will allow you to see the picture as it is being built. There are many many more features in Picture Puzzle so read on, and enjoy the program!

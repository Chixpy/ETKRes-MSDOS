"WARSHIPS 2.5 is the ""Classic"" Battleship Game, written for the purist who wants an unadulterated version of the original game. Play is against the computer with both player selection of ship position and random ship positioning. Other options include which player goes first, play level (one of three), single shot and salvo mode, and sound toggle. Input can be via a mouse, joystick, or keyboard with both the joystick and keyboard using a mouse-like interface. As reviewed in Shareware Magazine Vol. VIII No. 1 JAN-FEB 1993 pp 41-42, ""from the depth charges to sinking sounds, this version of Warships [v2.1] brings dazzling new dimensions to the game, complete with ripples in the water for each shot fired."" And that was for WARSHIPS 2.1!

New features in WARSHIPS 2.5 include the addition of a SALVO mode, an optional ""smarter"" random ship placement algorithm, and an improved EXPERT level of play. For more information on these features, please read the WARSHIPS.DOC file."

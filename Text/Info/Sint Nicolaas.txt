Another great platform game from the author of Charlie the Duck and other "jumping" games, Sint Nicolaas involves racing against the clock to collect gingerbread cookies and presents and deliver them to the proper houses before time runs out. Many different levels and a very clean design make this game fun to play, even if it"s not the Christmas season!

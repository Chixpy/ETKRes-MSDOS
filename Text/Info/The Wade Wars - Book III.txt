"Uncle Seamore is a scientific wizard. Other members of your family may dispute this and warn you not to hang around ""Simple Simon"" for fear of some of his craziness rubbing off on you, but even as far back as your earliest memories you have always seen him for the genius he is.

True, he is a bit of a hermit and many of his experiments do run awry; but his odd ways can easily be explained by the fact that he was trapped in the basement of a closed garage for close to ten years. Now he has disappeared for a second time leaving no message of his whereabouts. The rest of the family simply laugh, joking that he is probably locked in another basement; but you know better.

You are closer to Uncle Seamore than anyone else, and you know that he would tell you if he were planning on leaving. You fear the worst and decide to search his apartment for clues..."

This is actually the first game released in the Wade War series (it appears the others were never finished). Originally released as shareware, it has now been made freeware by the author.

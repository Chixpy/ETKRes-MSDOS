At the Zoo and Dinos are Forever are two more entries in Brian Rice"s prolific Electric Crayon series.Like other entries, these programs are electronic coloring books that feature lots of attractive pictures for kids to draw in, a nice mouse-driven interface, and even educational value: kids will learn about different types of animals and dinosaurs respectively in these two programs. You can also ask the program to color the pictures (randomly) for you, print the finished page (although not by anything more modern than dot-matrix printers), and call up the help menu. All in all, nice - albeit simplistic - coloring programs to bring out the artist in your kids. Recommended, although not Top Dogs.

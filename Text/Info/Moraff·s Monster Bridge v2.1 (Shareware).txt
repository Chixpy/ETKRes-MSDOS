"This distant relative of the Bridge card game so popular on Earth, is played frequently in the finer taverns of Moraff"s World. You will play against Devilishly clever monsters as you try to use your puny human brain to defeat them!

Monster Bridge has better graphics than any card game ever produced, including solitaire for Windows! The stunning graphics are rivaled only by other high-res MoraffWare games."

SSI"s first game for the PC was "...an operational simulation of the Battle of the Bulge, its most serious problem was a user interface which refused to allow the player to access his units. Instead, the order of battle was cycled through three times, and pity the gamer who did not input his orders by the third time -- primitive graphics, primitive play mechanics and a poor user interface."

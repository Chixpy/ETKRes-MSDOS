A quick DOS coffee break random dungeon crawl similar to Rogue, DnD, or Telengard.

From the packaging:

Battle through 9 levels (or more ?) of nasties, to defeat the evil Snap Dragon. Move your hero, represented by the cross on screen, using the cursor keys. When a menu is shown in the bottom right window, use the up/down cursor keys to choose the option. Quite simple.

" Computer games for Windows are something of a niche market, but stepping into that niche is jSOFT"s first entry into computer gaming: Second Conflict. A strategic space game of colonization and conquest, Second Conflict plays to the genre of games like Reach for the Stars and Armada 2525.

After the War of Consolidation, the Empire has been quiet for 73 years. Now, the emperor has died without an heir, bringing chaos to the recent order. Governors, generals and admirals all vie in a multi-faceted struggle for power and galactic supremacy. Players must restore the peace (on their own terms, of course) in this clean playing, menu driven game of strategy and warfare.

Each of the approximately 25 systems in the 6 scenarios can produce one item (in quantity) at a time from a shopping list including: warships, stealth ships, transports, troops, missiles, system defenses, factories and planets. Each star can support up to 10 planets and 50 factories. Each ""piece"" in the game interacts in an easy-to-understand way, so players can concentrate on winning strategy instead of rule reading."

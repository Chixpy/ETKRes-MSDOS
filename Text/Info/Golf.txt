This particular computer adaptation of golf is entirely text-based.  Each tee has a different length and par, and the player swings by choosing a type of club to use: the arsenal includes four woods (numbered 1 through 4), eight irons (2 through 9) and a wedge for when you get closer to the hole.  Once you"re on the green, you get to use a putter: the putt is controlled by a number from 1 (minimum distance, maximum accuracy) to 10 (the reverse). 

After each swing, you get an update with the results and your current distance to the hole.  Lose the ball entirely, and you"ll have to replay with a two-stroke penalty.  After you play all nine holes, you can choose to play nine more - or quit and see your scores.

This is a fantasy role playing game based on the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. This game covers the first novel in the trilogy. Although the game follows the book, it also adds plenty of its own elements. Your quest is to carry the one ring to Mordor, and destroy it, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.

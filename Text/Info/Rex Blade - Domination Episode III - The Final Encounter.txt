In the 35th century, mankind developed almost god-like technology to create Cyborg slaves - machines so shrewd they were almost human. In time, the Cyborgs waged war against man to control the earth. After emerging victorious, mankind banished the Cyborgs to a distant star system via a transdimensional teleporter. It"s now 500 years later, and the Cyborgs are planning a massive offensive against mother Earth. You are Rex Blade, part human, part Cyborg, and mankind"s last hope. Your mission is to teleport yourself to the Cyborg world and eradicate all life there, before they can destroy earth. A massive arsenal of powerful futuristic weapons will help you succeed. The graphics and the level design are similar to the ones seen in Rise of the Triad, however more futuristic. One really special thing about this game is REX++. This is a programming language within the game, that let"s you develop your own programs and games within Rex Blade itself helping you strengthen your abilities and reflexes.

The game itself consists of 3 different episodes:

Rex Blade - The Battle Begins, Rex Blade - The Battle Rages on and Rex Blade - The Final Encounter.

Xtreme Games originally planned to release each of those episodes separately, making the game a trilogy. However only the first episode, Rex Blade - The Battle Begins, was released as planned by Xtreme Games and Simon&Schuster. After deciding not to release the other two episodes, all three of them were combined and sold as Rex Blade: The Apocalypse. Later, Xtreme Games published the game itself and changed the title to Domination, still including all three episodes.

A challenging future hockey game, with fast and smooth action, and crisp
graphics. You can play against a friend, one of the computer teams, or try
to win the Solar Hockey League itself.

After the latter half of the 21st century, which had North America playing a
very minor role both politically and economically, there was a worldwide
(solar-system-wide actually) revival of ancient North American sports in the
22nd century, most notably of ice hockey. But in accordance with the true
spirit of the time, the players in the game were actually robots, controlled
externally by teams of humans. The sport, originated among American immigrants
in southwestern South America, proved to be very popular, especially in the
various human colonies on planets in the solar system. Now you have a chance
to challenge the teams in the Solar Hockey League.

One of the first games to feature SVGA graphics, Amazon is a "b" movie adventure game about a 1957 expedition into the heart of the amazon basin.  "A desperate, crazed message sends you on a perilous search through a land where legends come to life, danger hides behind every corner, and incredible treasures wait to be discovered."

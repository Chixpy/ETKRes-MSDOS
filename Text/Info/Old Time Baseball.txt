The premise behind this game is to put together practically every team and player from 1871 to 1981 against each other without having to worry about the consequential time paradoxes. The game uses the same graphics engine as Tony La Russa 3, only with "aged" courts and players. You can play in either exhibition modes, or a series of season modes where you control the entire team through playoffs, etc. doing the drafts by yourself. The final prize? an all-star game with everyone from Cobb to Paige.

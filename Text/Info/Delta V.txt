This is a futuristic flying game. The plot casts you as a captured Nethacker forced to Netrun for the mercenary Black Sun Corporation for their own greedy purposes.

Just what is Netrunning? in the year 2306 5 megacorporations control the world, each of which requires lots of data and information to mantain their position at the top of the food chain. If a certain data can"t be obtained peacefully they then resort to hacking the other corporation"s net with cybernetically enhanced individuals (such as yourself) that can cruise the Networks in virtual vehicles called Traces. This then means that as a Netrunner you have to "race" in futuristic trenches and several other Tron-like settings while avoiding ICEs and other countermeasures and trying to achieve mission objectives like capturing a certain data file, clearing up a Net of intruders, etc.

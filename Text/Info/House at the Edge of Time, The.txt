When your eccentric uncle dies he leaves behind his vast fortune to you. The catch? You"ve gotta spend one chilling night at his Pseudo-Tudor-Greco-Gothic-Byzantine mansion. The other catch? Well it seems that the laws of space and time don"t really apply within its walls. As you roam around his house you"ll run into characters and creatures from all over the place and if you survive long enough you"ll be greatly rewarded.

The House at the Edge of Time is a text adventure which takes place within one house. The usual rules of the text adventures apply in regards to movement and interaction. Movement is made through the various scenes by typing in the directions you"d like to move such as North, South, or N, S for short. Interaction with objects that you "look" at are done by figuring out the vocabulary of the game and applying it by typing simple phrases like "Take flower" or "Pull door". A list of inventory of items you"ve picked up is also available by typing out inventory.

Fritz 2.00 is a great program that is currently the most powerful artificial chess player in the world.This is the early version of Deep Fritz 8, the program that tied 2:2 in an exciting match with world champion Garry Kasparov. Even in this early incarnation, released by ChessBase in 1993 to a limited number of retail channels, you can already see how powerful Fritz is. It is a very tough chess opponent that rarely makes "mistakes." I am not a good enough chess player to vouch for its AI, but I asked a friend who was a New England champion at one point and he said it definitely plays much better chess than most programs - and probably was the best in 1993, when it was released. Although the game is more or less a "no frills" chess program with limited options, it does have an intuitive mouse-based interface, crisp graphics, and plenty of historical playing books you can use. 

Definitely one of the most powerful, although not completely accessible, chess programs ever made. If you like this game, check out Deep Fritz 8, the latest release at ChessBase"s website below. Yes, it is very expensive, but a real brain deserves a high price ;) Two thumbs up, way up!

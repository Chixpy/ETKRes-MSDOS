Next stop "Snake" game from Danish lone developer, originally from the mid-1980s. Gameplay, oddly enough, is hardly simple. And in this case it is not a positive characteristic. The playing field is limited to the small screen to the right side of the maze, which need to be overcome, if intended for devouring segment appears in its territory. Themselves squares, mining worm may be of different sizes, that is, to require the various costs of efforts aiming at, which is complicated by the fact that the worm is very thin, ie, the field turns out very large and find out exactly is the goal on a selected path or not, is extremely problematic. Hunt also prevent unresponsive even at a very slow speed control (speed, limiting the time between eating squares and other settings can be set before the start of the game) and a nasty bug due to which it becomes impossible to eating a square if he appeared on the site, through which at the moment creeping worm body. Why suddenly someone might want to play the game - hard to say. Even in the same 1986 he published a more successful and interesting clone of "snake" called Serpy .

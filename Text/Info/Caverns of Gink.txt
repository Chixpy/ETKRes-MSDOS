In Caverns of Gink you control Prof. George Jumpalot on a quest to find a sacred statue left by the Ginkians, an ancient tribe of headhunters. The statue is somewhere in a large cave; you will need to explore the entire cave in order to find it. The cave consists of numerous red platforms; as you walk over each platform, the color changes to brown. When all of the platforms have been changed to brown the level is complete. The Ginkians are still around, however! They are trying to stop you from your goal by constantly shooting green arrows. This are poisonous and will cause you to lose a life if hit; if hit too many times the game is over. Prof. George Jumpalot can move left, right, jump, or fall in order to reach all of the platforms and dodge the arrows.

Air Trax is an air traffic control tower simulation game very very similar to Air Traffic Controller. This is an ASCII text based air traffic control simulation where planes need to be guided to land safely before they run out of fuel or crash. However this game seriously complicates things with the inclusion of three different types of aircraft: jets, small craft, and super sonic jets. Players can also earn a salary.

This installment in the series features a very similar tactical combat system, granting each character a variety of attacks with different ranges that deplete special points. It differs from its predecessors by having much more developed adventure-like visual novel segments. The game has an internal clock for each day, and the player is free to choose various locations within the school and the city from a menu. Each such visit advances the clock by a certain amount of time. Depending on the player"s choices different scenes can be unlocked.

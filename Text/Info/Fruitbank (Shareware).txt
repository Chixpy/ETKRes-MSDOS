You start each game with 30 credits, which will decrease by one each time the START button is pressed.  Once all credits have been used, the game is over, where, if you did really well, you may have a hi-score!

When START is flashing, pressing it will spin the reels.  Once stopped, you will either have a win, or, if you don"t have a win, you may have some features.

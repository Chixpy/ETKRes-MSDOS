Sesame Street: Opposites Attract is yet another entry in "Electric Crayon," a long line of electronic coloring books designed by Brian Rice and published by Merit Studios.In addition to featuring most of the cast from Sesame Street, Opposites Attract goes beyond most electronic coloring books in offering some educational value: teaching kids about opposites. The interface is easy to use, the pictures are fun to color, and the palette is adequate. Recommended for young fans of Sesame Street in your house. Too bad the program is too old to be compatible with most modern printers, though.

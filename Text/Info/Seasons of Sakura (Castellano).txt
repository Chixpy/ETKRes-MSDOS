You are Shuji Yamagami, a sixteen-year-old Japanese boy, and this is your first day at the Kotobuki Preparatory School, where most of the student are already eighteen or older. It"s not easy to be a new student, and it is also not easy to make a closer acquaintance with one of the many attractive girls who study together with you...

Seasons of Sakura is a manga/hentai interactive story, which can hardly be called "adventure" due to a complete lack of puzzles or other challenges. The story proceeds as you go to different places, meet different characters and talk to them. The gameplay and the interface are quite similar to those of Three Sister"s Story, developed by the same company. There are several options at each screen, including "think" option. The view is 1st person perspective, with still pictures of locations and characters (mostly girls ;)) Needless to say there are many explicit erotic scenes in the game.

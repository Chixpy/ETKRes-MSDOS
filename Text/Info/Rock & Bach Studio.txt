The last release from underrated edutainment developer Electronic Zoo is a great all-in-one music game and application with virtually unlimited playability.Rock & Bach Studio has two major components: music education, and music making. As part of the music education component, kids can read up on an excellent synopsis of the music pieces that comprise an orchestra. For each instrument, the game shows where it is in the orchestra, what it looks and sounds like, what its sound wave looks like, and a short history and explanation. The basics of musical notations are also included, so kids will learn for instance what a treble looks like, and how the F major scale is different from the one in D minor. 

The second major element of the program is the music making part. Here is where the fun begins: kids can choose the various cartoon characters to form their band, give the band a name, then head off to the studio when they will be able to "compose" songs by choosing from different pre-set riffs, which can be customized to their heart"s content. Rock & Bach even offers an option to create and save a music video by matching songs with backgrounds, character animations, and various visual efects. Overall, Rock & Bach a fun music activity for kids that teaches as much as entertains, and allows kids to make their own music that covers a wide spectrum of styles -- from Back to Rock "n Roll, of course ;) Highly recommended!

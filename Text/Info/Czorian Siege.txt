Czorian Siege is an arcade action game similar to Space Invaders. You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and need to defend yourself from the waves of attacking enemies. Each time you clear the screen of all enemies, you move on to the next, more difficult round. Each round also has a time limit; if the time limit expires but you still haven"t destroyed all of the enemies, you will move on to the next round anyway. There are eight different types of enemy ships that will appear, plus on many of the screens there is a shield which you will need to shoot through before you can hit the various ships. You begin the game with four lives, and additional lives can be earned for every 5,000 points. The game ends when you have lost all of your lives.

Another version of the game Space Invaders . You need to control a spaceship in the bottom of the screen and destroy the "wave" of enemy ships, which is nice, there are eight different types, and some are protective shields that must penetrate to destroy the ship. Each level is a separate screen and must be completed in a given period, and if the time is up, and you do not destroy all the enemies on it, then go to the next level will still happen, but you get less points (so you have to try to erase all). Initially, there are four life, getting five thousand points given another. Once all the lives lost - the game ends. Basically, there is nothing more to say specifically, but here is to note the remarkable for its time, the game schedule is necessary - because the enemy ships is not only the name, but also on external differences eight (though they look, of course, quite arbitrarily, even in the "color\u00bb CGA-mode). Verdict - not a hit, but to play, if you like such fun, is without fail.

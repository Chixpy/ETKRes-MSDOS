"SUBWAY SLEUTH is a game of underground transportation and above ground crime detection. For younger players, there is some redeeming educational value as the game uses logical problem solving skills and develops familiarity with the alphabet.

As the ""Subway Sleuth"" you are a detective in a big city where the main street is called Alphabet Avenue. It runs from A Street (Downtown) all the way up to Z Street (Uptown). The busiest intersections are the streets named after the vowels: A Street; E Street; I Street; O Street; U Street. Also, the city"s stores and services are located on streets with names that match the first letter of their descriptions (the bank is on B Street, the zoo is on Z Street, etc.)..."

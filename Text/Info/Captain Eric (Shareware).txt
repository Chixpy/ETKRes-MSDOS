Captain Eric is a vaguely Gauntlet-like game that involves avoiding or shooting enemies ("aliens"), collecting powerups, and finding the exit through various mazes. One nice touch is that the mazes are partially randomly generated. That is, each progressive level has a basic design, but the particular layout of each level is different each time you play. Despite the random element, the bland EGA graphics and questionable controls dampen the fun a bit.

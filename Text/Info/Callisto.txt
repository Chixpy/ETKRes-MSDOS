Callisto was written by Russell Wallace in 1987, inspired by a game called Ganymede back on the 3.5K Vic-20 but obviously is a huge improvement on that game (well, I think so anyway!). In the game you are in charge of a mining base on Jupiter"s moon Callisto. The moon itself contains nothing more valuable than ice and dirt, but valuable minerals can be obtained from the atmosphere of Jupiter itself by robot mining stations (human workers could not survive the conditions there). Your job is to collect the ore produced and bring it up to the moon using short-range nuclear drive spacecraft. From there it can be collected by long-range ion drive ships for your employers, the Interplanetary Mining Corporation. You will be paid for the ore and must this money to buy various equipment and plutonium fuel to run it.

Panda Dodgeball is a sports game that parodies characters and themes from Sango Fighter. The object, like in real dodgeball, is to hit the players on the other team with the ball. The teams consist of three players each. Graphics are done in a "super-deformed" style. Characters possess special powers that can be used beside regular dodgeball moves. The game features several ending sequences.

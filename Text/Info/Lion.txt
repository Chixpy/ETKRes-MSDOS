Lion is a sequel to Wolf: you are now placed in the same simulation environment, but this time you simulate a....you guessed it, a lion.

As in the original you take the role of a lion chosen from a pool of 20 different animals, with varying attributes, in existing prides or handpicked groups made by yourself. You can control a single animal or all members of a pride and you get to play in either a 20-mission mode (such as survive for a day) or a simulation mode, which allows you to do whatever you want.

Unlike Wolf, which takes place in three different locales, Lion is played only on the savannas and plains of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (tough in four different seasons).

Also includes a "Lion Safari", an interactive tour of the leonine life on the Serengeti.

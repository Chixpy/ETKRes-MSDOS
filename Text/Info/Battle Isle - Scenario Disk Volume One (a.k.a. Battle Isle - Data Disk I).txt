The battle for Chromos continues in this add-on to Battle Isle. It features 24 new maps for play against the computer, 8 new two-player maps and two new landscape types: ice and desert.

The gameplay is the same as in the original game. On a split screen, one player moves his units while the other player attacks and vice versa. A map is won when all enemy units are destroyed or the enemy headquarters are captured.

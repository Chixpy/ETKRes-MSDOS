One of Origin"s sub-par RPGs, Tangled Tales is a small, "light" RPG that tries too hard to introduce the genre to new gamers through dumbed-down combat, simplified statistics, and mundane plot.However, it"s still a good introductory-level game that"s charming in its own way. Just don"t expect it to be another Ultima, and you"ll be enjoying this one :)

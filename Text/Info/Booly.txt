Booly is a fun puzzle game similar to Tetris but with a dash of electronics circuitry thrown in.The goal, as in all good puzzlers, is easy to say but hard to achieve: you have to bring all the objects you see on your screen to their "GOOD" state which is indicated on the control panel. For example, all the blue squares on the first level must become grey. You click on the objects to reverse their color. But to make things more difficult for you, some of the objects may be connected, so if you click on one of them, others may react too and be reversed. Normally the connections are invisible, but you have the possibility to see them for a short period. If you choose to see the connections, your time potential is discounted rapidly and you may "lose" the level by running out of time. 

Like all good Tetris clones, Booly comes equipped with a variety of hidden bonuses. The more objects you manage to stack up on a line, the better the bonuses. The game also offers additional challenge by way of "challenge" levels, which are identical to regular levels except they are much harder, and allow you to see the time left by clicking right mouse button.
 
Overall, Booly is a fun little puzzler that"s worth a play or two. Not incredibly addictive, but still a nice Tetris variant with some original ideas. It even features one of Bach"s masterpieces as background music :)

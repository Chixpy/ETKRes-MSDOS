This is the original Russian version of Lines. It is a turn-based board game. Each turn, three randomly colored balls fall on random grids of a 9x9 squares board. Your mission is to re-locate the balls (by moving one of them per turn) to form lines consisting of five or more balls of the same color. The lines can be arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each line you build immediately disappears, giving you points. There is basically no end to the game, but your first objective is to surpass the 3000 points scored by the "king". Once you surpass him, he loses the throne and you become the new king, but the game continues ad infinitum. You lose when the entire board is filled with balls.

The only IF from Wizardry maker is a decent dungeon romp in the spirit of Zork (only with a more serious undertone and better plot).While enjoying your holidays in the mountains, you encounter a strange dying man who asks you to find the magical Orb and use it to vanquish the evil Usurper, hence freeing the imprisoned tribe from the mines of Qyntarr. Good puzzles, imaginative denizens of the mines, and a competent parser make this a solid IF.

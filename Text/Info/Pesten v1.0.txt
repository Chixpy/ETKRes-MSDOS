Pesten is a Dutch card game, I am told it is known in the rest of the world as UNO, but slightly different. 
The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards, while the computer also attempts to do this. The game is over when a player has no cards left, so he/she wins, or the player has more than 22 cards. This is actually a rule made by myself, due to lack of cards space... (and my programming capabilities :-) but it is unusual to happen, so 22 cards should be enough. Maybe the game is not according to the rules how it should be played, but I just forgot them, and nobody can recall the real rules, so I "invented" them myself.

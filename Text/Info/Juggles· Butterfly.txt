Juggles" Butterfly is an educational game for children ages 3-6. The game includes a keyboard template with two blue lines which will divide the keyboard into four sections. During the game you will be asked to press keys which are located above, below, to the left, or to the right of the blue lines that are placed on the keyboard. With a correct answer colored shapes will appear on the screen. Afterwards there is a free form mode where you can "create" an animated picture; pressing a key on the corresponding section of the keyboard will draw a section of either a rainbow, butterfly, or windmill or change the colors that are used once the image is complete.

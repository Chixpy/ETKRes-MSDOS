Infocom"s third murder mystery game no longer puts you in the shoes of a police detective, but a nosy reporter who has been framed with the murder of Veronica Ashcroft, a famous superstar who has been murdered at her own halloween party.Similar to Deadline, you have only 12 hours to find the real killer. 

Compared to the first two mystery games, Deadline and The Witness, Suspect stacks up well against both of them, thanks to the complex storyline and many interesting characters. Similar to Deadline, you can replay the game many times and never reach the "optimal ending." Suspect suffers from one problem that plagues Deadline: you need to witness a few critical events at the right time and place, but some of these events seem to appear quite randomly, or without sufficient clues. Fortunately, the intriguing plot and solid writing helps replaying Suspect less of a chore than it would otherwise be. If you like murder mystery games, Suspect still ranks as one of the very best. In terms of difficulty level, I would put it one notch above The Witness but not as hard as Deadline. Two thumbs up!

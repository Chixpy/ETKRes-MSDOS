Search for the Titanic is a simulation of wreck-hunting game that offers plenty of realistic options.As in its spiritual descendant Sea Rogue, you are in command of a wreck hunting expedition. However, the emphasis here is on the planning stages, when you must carefully hire personnel, buy or rent a ship and equipment, and seek grants to fund the expedition. After building up anticipation, the actual dive is quite a letdown as it"s nowhere near as detailed. A combination of pre-dive stages of this game and Sea Rogue"s dive would have made an ideal wreck hunting game :)

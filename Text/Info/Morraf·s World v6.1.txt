Moraff"s World is a shareware role-playing game.

There are many dungeons and continents to explore. All the dungeons are randomly generated, though once the game is played for the first time the dungeons stay the same afterwords. There are over 40 different monsters with different attributes and weak points and 200 levels of each dungeon to play.

The dungeons are explored in first person view, but on the surface the view changes to top-down. There are also many items to collect, from holy hand grenades to a standard set of plate mail armor. 

Registering the shareware version opens up new levels.

8088 Othello is a four-color ASCII graphic board game similar to Reversi. The game is for 1 player and you battle against the computer to get more of your pieces on a board. In every game you only play with the black pieces. There are five levels of gameplay that go from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). The board you play on features coordinates in which you type in the order to pick a place for your pieces. However, your pieces will only go on lines that are either vertical, horizontal or diagonal to one of your previous pieces. You also have four options: pass, switch, unmove and quit at the main menu. The game does not feature any high scores.

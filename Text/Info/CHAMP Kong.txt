CHAMP Kong is a DOS shareware remake of the classic Donkey Kong arcade machine. Like the other games in CHAMProgramming"s series of arcade remakes, it closely emulates the original with two different game modes, the original "Classic" mode and an enhanced "Champ" mode.

The "Classic" mode plays and feels much like the arcade machine, with very similar graphics, sound and gameplay. Gameplay is well-known: You play Jumpman, having to rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of love-sick giant ape Kong, by running, jumping an climbing to get to the top of the skyscraper. You can pick up your girlfriend"s lost items for bonus points and grab a hammer to smash barrels and fireballs thrown at you by Kong.

The "Champ" mode is an upgraded version of the classic game, featuring different levels and more bonuses.

Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty settings, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a "Champ cable" that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.

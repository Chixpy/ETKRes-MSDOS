A fun and hardly-known multiplayer fighting game that"s designed by Marti Wong, resident designer of Softstar (one of the best Taiwanese developers).Up to 4 players can join the all-out fistfights that feature cute SD-style graphics and cool weapons. Animations are superb, as is the control scheme. The game is most fun with friends huddled around the computer :) Be sure to check out the even better sequel Little Fighter 2!

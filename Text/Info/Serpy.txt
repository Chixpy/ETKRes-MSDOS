Serpy is a serpent -- serpent, as in snake, as in... this is a snake game.  Gameplay is quite limited as these things go: the player directs Serpy ever onward toward small, randomly appearing particles of what must be food or some other snake-growth stimulant... upon consuming them Serpy extends in length, eventually running the risk of colliding with his own obscenely elongated coils.  Barring surrounding walls, no other obstacles litter the playfield; rather this game is one of endurance, seeing for how long the player can neatly navigate the playfield before tripping up over his own snakeskin.

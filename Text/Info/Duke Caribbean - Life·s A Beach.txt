Duke Caribbean: Life"s A Beach is an add-on episode for Duke Nukem 3D version 1.3d and up.

Ahh... the Caribbean, the ultimate vacation destination.  After a few months of alien annihilation, Duke"s ready for a little R&R. That is, until the alien scum drop in for a little vacation of their own.

The add-on includes 7 new levels plus one secret level as well as 4 extra DukeMatch levels; all with new, tropical background music. The weapons and power-ups are the same, but they have new, beach-themed appearances (squirt guns, coconut launchers, and more!). The aliens, too, are now dressed in beach apparel.

Blockage is your basic breakout clone. You have to keep your ball from getting past you and you have to destroy all of the bricks. There is one or two blocks in each level that you have to hit before you go onto the next level. If you hit it at the beginning, everything explodes and you get all of the points. If you hit it at the end, all of the bricks are gone so you already have all of the points so you just go to the next level. You can collect the hearts for extra lives. Everytime you hit a break, it explodes, sending debris everywhere so you have to pay attention or you might lose your ball in the confusion. There is no sound or highscore list. There also aren"t any power-ups. It"s just your basic, no frills, breakout game.

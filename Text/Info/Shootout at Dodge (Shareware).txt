"Welcome to Dodge City, the wildest, wooliest cattle town this side of the Pecos. The town is crawling with the men of the Butch Cameron Gang. And your job is to clean the town up.

You are Marshall Mellow. The folks think you"re soft, and would like to see you over a fire at the campsite. But if you can make it through all the business places in Dodge, and put these black hats in Boot Hill without having to stay there yourself, you just might win the respect of the the town. Good luck. "

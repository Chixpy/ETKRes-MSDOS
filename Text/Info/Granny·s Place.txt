Another lackluster text adventure from Temple Software, Granny"s Place, despite the innocuous name, is a *cough* adult game with an almost nonexistent plot, ridiculous puzzles, and more stereotypical comments and "cheap" jokes than you can expect to find in a single game.

The goal of the game is simple: gain access into Granny"s Place, an --umm-- entertainment venue the game describes, quite frankly, as "a pleasant little house where a man with time on his hands and a pair of tight balls can go to loosen up." Puzzles involve dealing with the bouncer who guard the doors to gain access to see Granny"s women, and then, well, you know. Aside from the fact that Granny"s Place ranks among the first adult IF ever written, I don"t know why anyone would want to play this game. It has horrible parser, poor writing, and cardboard-cutout characters that are about as interesting to talk to as pebbles on a beach. And to make matters worse, the adult scene the game keeps promising you is basically nonexistent. As tasteless as IF goes.. play something else if you can help it.

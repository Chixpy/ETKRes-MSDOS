Tetris Pro is a nice looking Tetris clone with some additional options that may interest Tetris fans. It includes various modes, powerups, etc, and also slowly reveals a picture as you complete more lines. It generally looks nice and plays well, although I had some crashing difficulties when playing it using DOSBox. (Note: It"s probably a good idea to turn off SFX on the main menu to disable the annoying explosion sound effect, especially when running this game in DOSBox.)

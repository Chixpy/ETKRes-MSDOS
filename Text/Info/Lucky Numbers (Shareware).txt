"Lucky Numbers takes place during the year of 1993. You have one year to win a million or better yet, a billion dollars. Using strategy and finance skills you need to make important decisions on how to invest your money.

The game starts off the day after you are fired from your job at the state lottery. You have only $500 (if you start at the normal level) to invest in the weekly lottery drawing. To help you decide what numbers will be drawn each week you can use the contacts you made during your brief employment with the state lottery."

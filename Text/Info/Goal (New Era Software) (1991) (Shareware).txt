"This is THE game of international soccer team management, from the writers of THE SOCCER GAME, much acclaimed by football addicts from all over the world.

So you want to manage a national football team ? Well this is your big chance: 128 countries to choose from, incorporating almost the entire membership of FIFA. Your challenge is to select your squad and team for each match, and by careful selection of overall team tactics and individual player tactics, for each match in the four year international season, to take your chosen team on to win the continental championships and ultimately the World Cup. Easier said than done."

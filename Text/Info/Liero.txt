Liero is like Worms but with players battling in realtime instead of turn-based.

At the start of the game, each player chooses 5 weapons from a vast weapons array, 40 in total. The weapons range from simple pistols and shotguns to bazookas and the ever deadly cluster bombs (known in the game as the chiquita bomb)

Players can dig through mud, jump and throw ninja ropes to navigate through the area. The players must seek each other out and destroy the opposing player. When a worm is hit, ridiculous amounts of blood spurts around. All weapons have infinite ammo, however they do need to be reloaded after emptying a clip. Reloading takes a few seconds, and during this time the player cannot fire. The more powerful a weapons is, the sooner it needs to be reloaded, sometimes after every single shot.

During the game, players can pick up crates with weapon power-ups. When collected, the weapon power-up replaces whatever weapon is in the active weapon slot.

"Over two centuries ago you were one of the many followers of Lord Trentarus. He was a fair and just leader, although slightly morbid. To insure his continuing reign, and continued victory over enemies, he ordered his best mages to create a powerful magical device for him. He also ordered that it be a sarcophagus so that he may be buried in it, and thus be one with it through eternity. Hence the Cyan Sarcophagus was created. It was made out of pure wizidrium, the most magically potent element known to mankind.

Lord Trentarus also ordered his followers to construct a large crypt, and bury him and the sarcophagus in it upon his death. The order didn"t stop there, as all of his followers were to seal themselves in with him.

Finally the day came when Lord Trentarus was laid to rest, and everyone entered the crypt. You were the one charged with the unenviable task of sealing the doors to the crypt, and to guard them against grave robbers.

Two centuries have passed, and now a new threat has emerged. But it is not coming through the doors, it is coming from the central tomb, from the sarcophagus itself! A creature, neither human nor demon, is attempting to enter your world through the sarcophagus. Grave sites always have a weak ethereal curtain, as holes must be punched through it to enable undead creatures to exist. Since the ethereal plane connects all realities, the monster was able establish remote contact with the sarcophagus. So far it has managed to gather enough power to send a few of its minions through, which you will have to defeat first.

Now you have a great task ahead of you, as the menace you must defeat is on the other side of the crypt, and you must get passed all of the traps that were set to keep the grave robbers out! Good luck, thou shalt need it."

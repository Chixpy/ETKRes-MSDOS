The game of BIG2 originated in Hong Kong, where gambling is a way of life. BIG2 is now played by almost 99% of the oriental population and ranks as second to Mahjong in social entertainment.

Although simple to learn, when played in the hands of a master, Big2 has the avant-garde of chess and the finesse of bridge.

The object of this game is to be the first player to play all the cards in their hand while attempting to maximize the number of cards remaining in the other players hands.

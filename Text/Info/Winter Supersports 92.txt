Winter Supersports 92 is a fun winter sports game from Flair that deserves much more notice that it received (the game was never released in the U.S.). While not nearly as polished as Accolade"s popular Winter Challenge, WS92 nonetheless is much better than many similar games of its time.

In the beginning which most sports fans should be familiar with by now, you will first need to select a country to represent in the game. Two modes of play are available: Competition and Challenge. Competition mode allows up to 6 players to play one or more events, which can be played and replayed as many times as desired. This is a good way to practice to prepare for the Competition mode, in which you compete against the computer. In this mode, all 8 events must be played in order and the aim is to gain as many points as possible. Each event has a points level which you must exceed in order to progress to the next event. If you fail to achieve the "PAR" value score for an event, then the challenge fails and you must recommence the challenge or return to the Competition mode for more practice.

The game features a nice variety of winter events that include both traditional (downhill skiing, bobsled, luge, speed skating) as well as not-so-typical and modern events (bale jumping, pro ski challenge, skidoo racing). Pro ski challenge and skidoo racing are my favorite events in the game, and the head-to-head nature of the competition can get quite exciting (and hard on the joystick)! The user interface is generally well-designed, although the animations of athlete are not as good as Winter Challenge. Overall, though, Winter Supersports 92 offers a nice range of winter sports, some of which are not commonly seen in PC games, that should keep winter fans happy for a while. Recommended, although not a Top Dog in my book.

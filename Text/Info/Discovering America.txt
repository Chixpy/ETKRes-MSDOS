Discovering America is a fun game that is derivative of MECC"s famous Oregon Trail, but offers many innovations of its own.Designed for children aged 8 and up, this adventure for children combines American history and geography in an exciting game. You are a Spanish explorer who has just set foot on America"s shore. You will trudge through swamplands, deal with alligators, and battle time and the elements - all while building an exploration route through early America. As you (or your cihld) explore the New World and learns about its cultures and events, you will come across many factoids and interesting anecdotes that encompass a wide range of subjects, from (historical) survival tips, to Indian culture. As in Oregon Trail, you must always keep track of your resources and plan to replenish or trade them wisely, lest you perish in the harsh environment. 

Fortunately, Discovering America has no arcade elements, so those who were frustrated with Oregon Trail"s many arcade sequences will be relieved. Overall, this is a good product with very high production values that does achieve its aim, although not by innovation. Thumbs up!

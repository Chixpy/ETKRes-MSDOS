3-D Dinosaur Adventure is an educational game about the many types of dinosaurs from Earth"s past. As the title suggests, the game has several areas that make use of the included blue-red 3-D glasses that make the dinosaurs appear to leap off the computer screen. 

Kids can learn using the reference encyclopedia section to explore when or where the dinosaurs lived, how they evolved, and what survival methods they used. The title has several learning activities that take advantage of the wealth of fossil photo records and illustrations for visual recognition of dinosaurs. It also has a movie theater that shows the dinosaurs" anatomy so that the kids understand the biology of the creatures. The 3-D museum allows you to walk around in a virtual museum, using your 3-D glasses to really bring impact to the creatures as they pop off the screen.

The game layout is stylized like a theme park, and has four main areas to explore with hidden items to find and experience.

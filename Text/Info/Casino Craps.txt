Casino Craps is another solid entry in Villa Crespo"s long line of casino games.As the name implies, the game lets you play a game of craps. Similar to Ruckus Roulette and Ruckus Poker, Casino Craps is chock full of options and a lot of nice details that make the game much more atmospheric than a typical casino game. Many of the curses computer players shout when luck left them are amusing, as well as  their grudging comments when luck is on your side. You can customize the game in many ways - even change the odds on the table. A description of each and every option in the game is only one keystroke away, and the game includes very comprehensive and well-written rules of craps. Overall, this is definitely one of the better casino games for PC, released at the time when Villa Crespo was at the height of their craft. Highly recommended to casino fans.

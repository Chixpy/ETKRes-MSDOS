Frankenstein is an average cartoon platformer from the UK division of Merit Studios.The game"s obscurity is probably due to the fact that it was released very quietly as a shareware title, and only in Europe. Gameplay is typical platform fare with a few twists, such as an inventory (although limited to only 2 items), and "blood level" which you must keep an eye on (you are Frankenstein, after all-although somehow you look more like Quasimodo from Hunchback of The Notre Dame than anything else). The game suffers from relative lack of monsters and repetitive levels, as well as uninspired attacks and general gameeplay. When all is said and done, Frankenstein doesn"t pack enough punch to sustain anyone"s interest for long, especially when compared with other, more famous cartoon platformers on the market. Thumbs down for this one.

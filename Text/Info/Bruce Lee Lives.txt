You play the part of Bruce Lee, the only man who can fight back against Master Po and his army of martial arts warriors. You have to stop their destruction on Hong Kong Island!

This martial arts game features a "learning" AI engine that can improve its strategy by examining and tracking your past actions... thus the player cannot beat the game by just re-using the same successful moves over and over again. This amounts to a difficult game where "the opponents very often beat the program"s designers!"

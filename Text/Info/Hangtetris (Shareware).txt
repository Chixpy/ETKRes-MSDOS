Hangtetris is a Tetris variant that doesn"t stray too far from the familiar Tetris mold. The main innovations here are more different block shapes that begin to drop at higher levels, and a much wider and taller playing field than usual. Other than that, not much new here, the graphics are passable but definitely not spectacular. There is also no "Next block" display which makes the game slightly more difficult.

"This is a fully animated classic battle ship type game. You play against one of enemy"s top commanders in a classic battle ship setting. A couple of twists adds fun and excitement to the action. Use your Infrared heat scope to help in locating the enemy"s ships. Each side can have one jet fighter helping in the attack. Each side can have up to 2 mines randomly placed in the opponent"s waters. Play at night or day time. Each side has 2 jammmers (electronic and heat) that will compound the others problems in trying to use electronic or infrared means to locate the others ships. If either side"s jammers take damage, the other side becomes much more effective when using its" Infrared scope and jet fighter. The registered version allows you to play against another human opponent.

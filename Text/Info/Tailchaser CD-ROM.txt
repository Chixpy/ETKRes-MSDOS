In Tailchaser the player controls an armed badger whose job description is to defend the land Ivy Island from parasites. Unfortunately a demon wants to extend his empire and sends his minions on a crusade. So the player jumps and fights through seven big side-scrolling levels to conquer them back and rescue their residents. 

Every level has a different theme like a ghost mansion or a forest. Because the levels are big the game gives marks and tips where to go when reaching a branch. Most of the enemies are dispatched with the badger"s gun which can be upgraded but sometimes there are puzzles to solve, e.g. a locked door needs a certain item to open which has to be found first. But because there is no time limit the player can take his time to solve them.

In Wrestle Angels, the player has to recruit a number of female wrestlers to participate in a fictional championship. The player can choose different wrestlers for each match. Each wrestler has a variety of special moves. When the match begins, the player controls the actions of the wrestler by selecting those moves in turn-based fashion, trying to predict what move the opponent wrestler will choose. 

After all of the player-controlled wrestlers have participated in a match, a decisive match between the strongest player-controlled wrestler and opponent wrestler takes place. The loser of this match removes part of her clothes on the ring. Apart from that, there are no sexual elements in the game, so it cannot be considered adult.

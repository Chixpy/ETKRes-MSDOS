This is a highly original game that unfortunately gets bogged down with extreme non-linearity.You are a superhero who has the special ability to take control of most people you meet by typing "BECOME [someone]" and looking at the world from their perspective. Despite exciting possibilities, solving the game is almost impossible because you *must* become someone to solve many puzzles, but precisely who to become is not always obvious. Recommended for veteran IF-er only, and be prepared to get frustrated in your quest to thwart the evil scientist.

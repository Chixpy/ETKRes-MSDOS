A fun game for toddlers ages 1 - 4 who are learning their first English alphabets, Mickey"s ABC"s is basically an update of Westwood"s earlier classic Donald"s Alphabet Chase, but with a different cast of characters and better sounds and graphics.Gameplay is a simple matter of typing any letter on the keyboard (lowercase or uppercase) and see Mickey walk to an object in his house that begins with that letter, and pronounces the word as it is spelled out on the screen. Objects from A to Z are all well animated and full of hidden surprises. Interacting with some objects even bring out mini-games or quizzes to make sure kids learn their ABC"s at the end of the day. Two thumbs up!

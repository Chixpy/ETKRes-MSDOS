Run "Em Over is a mini, top view,car driving game.You are a small dude on a map who controls a car with a remote controler.Your objective is simple.

You must stop hordes of ENEMIES who are invading from the opposite part of map to reach you by runing them over.

You can also deploy mines and use them to protect key positions.

ENEMY can attack you with grenades which can destroy your car.

Run "Em Over can be played in two scenarios.CITY and REMULAC. Only difference is in graphic and positions of blockers on the map.

Goal of Run "Em Over is to score highest possible number of kills and enter highscore. 

There is no progression, levels or cutscenes.

This is my attempt to create an addictive and replayable action game without progression.

This game contains bloody corpses,blood splattering and celebrates running over people or aliens. I don"t posses a wish to run over people with car in real life. This is a computer game. It"s not my fault that people get most amused with this kind of scenes. If I made a game where you collect bunnies with rainbow collored tricicle nobody would play the game.

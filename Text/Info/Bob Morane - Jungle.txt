The second of four games of the unknown we superhero Bob Moran of the Belgian francophone comics. Relatively detailed description of these games see on the page with the game Bob Morane: Chevalerie 1 . in this game, unlike the first, is set in the conditional "our" time (perhaps in the middle of the XX century). Chinese supervillain Yellow Shadow, the eternal enemy of the Moran, seeking to destroy the West, stole his friend, a great Scot Bill Ballantyne, but at the same time went to the jungle near the Eastern Cordillera, to search for a mysterious artifact Chibcha-muiskov (Note: this is what it means serious approach - Chibcha-muiski , according to the ideas of historians, it lived in the area!), which will help him destroy European civilization. Naturally, Bob must stop him. Gameplay - virtual shooting range in the first person with an automatic movement, horizontal screen saw the enemy - tried for a limited time to kill him before he kills us, then moved on. Graphics, as in all of the first three games of the tetralogy, the PC-version, alas, does not shine delights, but the game itself is in French (although the text is only in the background), but for collectors and fans of old galleries game fit is beyond doubt.

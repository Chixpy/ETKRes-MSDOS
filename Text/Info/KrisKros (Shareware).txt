Word games are quite popular now (the Windows game BookWorm is one of the most popular & addictive games on the web right now). KrisKros is just such a word game, and has NO relation to the awful rap duo from the 90"s. (Whew!) The object here is simply to use the letters given to build words by moving letter tiles into empty boxes. Good replay value since each level is randomly generated. (Note: There doesn"t seem to be any way to exit the game while the timer is ticking ...)

Biing!: Sex, Intrigue and Scalpels is an erotic hospital-management simulation. You must build a hospital, starting from buying a building for it, then hiring doctors, nurses and receptionists. The game contains typical management simulation elements, albeit with a humorous twist: the doctors are idiots who don"t really care for their patients, and the nurses have huge breasts and even do a little striptease from time to time.

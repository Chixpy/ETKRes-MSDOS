Love for Sail! is the sixth game in Al Lowe"s Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry unexpectedly receives a ticket to a cruise ship. Upon the arrival of the passengers, a mega-contest is announced. This contest includes various kinds of sports and activities, from bowling to love-making. The winner will get to "score" with the sexy Captain Thigh. Naturally, there is no way Larry can win this contest fairly, so he must use his brains to solve the tricky puzzles of the game, and to cheat his way into the Captain"s bed.

The game features a context-sensitive interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player can choose in order to interact with the given object. In addition to that, it is possible to try and type any other verb (provided the game understands it), just like in old adventure games with text interface. Sometimes it is necessary to think outside of the box and to come up with unusual actions in order to solve a puzzle.

A lot of new features have been added to this version that make the player into an "active" part of the game. Using a microphone, players can add their own voice, while using a scanner lets players  insert their own photos. Another feature that grabs attention is the automatic wallpaper. When Larry "scores" with a woman, that woman"s image can be displayed as wallpaper on the Windows 95 desktop.

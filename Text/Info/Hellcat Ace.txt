A classic 1st person flight simulation similar to Ace of Aces. In several missions you have to shoot down Japanese fighters and bombers. Through the front cockpit window you can see the sky and the ocean. Below the cockpit view is the instrument panel with engine power, altitude, fuel and your ammunition-counter. Through the a rear window you can see the enemies on your tail.

One of the oldest flight simulation for PC (along with the Spitfire Ace ). And if in that game, the action takes place in the European theater of World War II, here - in the Pacific. Otherwise, the differences are not so much: the same old graphics (with a first-person) and more than a conventional display of enemy aircraft, which are not always easy to spot, but not bad traced instrument panel with all key indicators (level of fuel and ammunition, the current altitude, engine condition), there is even a back window, through which you can see the enemy, sat down on a "tail." Play Of course, to be a pilot for the U.S. Air Force and fight the forces of the Japanese Empire. As in the Spitfire Ace , the campaign, there is only different scenarios to choose from (there are twenty pieces - from the Battle of Wake Island and Midway to capture the Mariana Islands, ie including all the major battles with the use of aircraft.) The diversity of landscapes is smaller than in SA , but it is quite understandable, because most of the action takes place over the ocean. Among the interesting features - the ability to save his life when hit the enemy in your plane, eject. Management and the gameplay as realistic as possible at the time of the game, but, like the others mentioned game, Hellcat Ace today is of interest to either history or to most hardcore oldgeymerov who do not stop no difficulties in studying the old favorite.

A mix-and-match program for kids, Dino-Sorcerer is probably best remembered as one of the earliest games coded by John Romero after he started working at SoftDisk. Dino-Sorcerer lets you create fictional dinosaurs from various parts You can then save the resulting dinosaur to disk or print  it. One of the most creative features in the game is that as you change a body part, the name of the dinosaur will also change accordingly. All the names sound semi-authentic, and some are quite amusing.

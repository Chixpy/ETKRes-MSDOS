Three ancient games (Astrosmash, Skiing, and Utopia) originally created for Intellivision which have been ported to DOS and released as freeware.

Back in the 1980s Intellivision was one of the really big game systems" producers. Children of all ages played Intellivision games and they were very high on Christmas shopping wish lists.

If you wish to revisit those halcyon days, or just ponder over what great grandfather played with on his game"s "computer", grab this collection straight from the early 80s.

The games are Astrosmash, Skiing, and Utopia -- a Space Invaders game, a downhill skiing game and possibly the first "sim" game. They have been ported over to DOS and have been released as freeware.

If the smell of an old pipe, of drinking mint juleps on a warm magnolia scented summer"s night, and of playing antiquated computer games teleports you into nostalgia then grab Intellivision for PC: Volume 1.

Graphics are, er... basic, animation is minimal and sound is barely one step better -- but it truly is great fun!

Gameplay isn"t as bad as the technocrats of the late 90s might think and once you get involved you can easily forget that it isn"t quite state-of-the-art.

Go on, treat yourself to a trip back into the dim dark past of home computing and grab a copy of Intellivision for PC: Volume 1.

(Suitable for Windows.)

An old, thoroughly average darts game from Melbourne House, originally released for the Amstrad computers.World Darts lets you play -- surprise!-- darts in a solo mode. In contrast to the usual power-meter interface, this game uses a strange and annoying moving-hand interface in which you must move the (very ugly) hand around the screen to throw darts. The trajectory is hard to predict, since there is no way to alter the power of your throw. Fans of the sport should play Bully"s Sporting Darts instead and leave this mouldie oldie alone.

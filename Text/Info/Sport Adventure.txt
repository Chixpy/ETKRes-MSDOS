Based on the same engine as Knowledge Adventure its first release, Knowledge Adventure (the company)"s Sport Adventure is a solid database of sport factoids and trivia, complete with hundreds of photos, intuitive interface, and timeline.Although it is more of an electronic database than a game, Sport Adventure does feature a "quiz" that is a lot of fun to play, especially since you are likely to come across many interesting serendipitous information while you search the program for an answer to quiz questions. The game is unfortunately too US-centric, as it includes only sports that are popular in the US: baseball, basketball, American football, ice hockey, golf, and boxing. Fortunately, the last category is the Olympics, which contains a lot of interesting anecdotes about famous gold medalists, and the stories of their toils and triumphs. The writing is also very readable and easy to understand, which gives an added benefit of being a good reading material for kids. Overall, Sport Adventure is definitely one of the best titles of its type, with a huge database that, while not detailed, has enough fascinating factoids to keep sports fans entertained for hours.

Mortar is a copycat game, but a pretty good one. In Mortar the object is to destroy your opponent"s tanks by setting the angle and velocity of your shots. Gameplay is livened up a bit by the inclusion of various weapons that you can buy. The main quibble with this game is the lack of computer opponents; you can only play against other human players. Other that that it has good graphics, but Scorched Earth (below) is still probably better in most aspects.

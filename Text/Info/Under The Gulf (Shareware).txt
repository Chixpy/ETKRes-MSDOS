UNDER THE GULF is a game which simulates the actions of a United States attack submarine. You, the player, are in control of the nuclear powered vessel while the computer controls an opposing fleet of ships and submarines. The game takes place in a 500nm x 500nm area of the Black Sea. In the south west corner, two land masses merge to form a natural canal into the Mediterranean Sea. YOUR MISSION is to keep all of the opposing ships from reaching the open waters of the Mediterranean. Your submarine has complete radar and sonar systems, short and long range torpedoes, defensive systems, mining systems, and extensive navigational capabilities.

A roguelike inspired by (and released at) the annual Assembly demoparties held in Helsinki"s Hartwall Areena, in this "virtual demo party simulation" the player controls the DemuLamu, an at-sign wandering around the partyplace at the "Helsinkifairsentter".  Here he encounters ELiTE dudes, whose eliteness he aspires to (and can achieve through defeating them in combat), Llamers, to impress with accounts of his elite exploits, and party organizers, who have far more important and pressing things to do than waste their time interacting with the likes of you.

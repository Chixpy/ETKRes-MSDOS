"The object of the game is simple. You control a space fighter and do battle with an incredibly powerful space battleship.

This battleship is equipped with a mighty arsenal of weapons including a plasma cannon that will destroy anything in its path as well as smaller homing torpedoes that lock onto your ship and relentlessly pursue you.

The battleship is surrounded with three spinning walls of energy. Your ship must shoot holes through the spinning walls and break through all three walls to clear a path to the center of the walls where the battleship awaits.

Once you have cleared a path the battleship will fire its cannon at you as you try to get a clear shot and destroy it."

"What is JimBall? Okay, to be blunt... JimBall is an arcade game! It isn"t Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter but we are rather proud of it! We made it with our eyes closed... well, okay we didn"t but...

JimBall"s objective is simple: Move the green Super Bubble around the screen avoiding death in many flavors. Death"s flavors are: Falling off the bottom of the screen and... ( register and find out! ) You are trying to save Super Bubble by getting him/her safely through a multitude of levels and traps and finally into a yellow doorway. Once you reach the doorway, you are sent to the next exciting, fun filled level.

Pretty simple huh? Well...."

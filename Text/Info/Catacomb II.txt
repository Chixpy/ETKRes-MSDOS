Petton Everhail, the most powerful magician in the world is hired to recover an enormous treasure buried deep beneath the ruins of the Kieralon Palace. However, the path to the treasure chamber is long and confusing and guarded by evil monsters such as goblins, skeletons, and worse.

Catacomb II, which was later renamed to The Catacomb, does not change the game principle of its predecessor, but offers 30 new levels to explore. Still, players explore the ruins from a top-down perspective, use their magical powers to fight enemies, and discover hidden passages.

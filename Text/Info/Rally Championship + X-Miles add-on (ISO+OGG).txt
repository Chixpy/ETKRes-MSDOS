In this rally game with 28 different tracks you can drive in six real rally cars, such as the Proton Wira or a Skoda. The weather is changing all the time, from rain to sun to snow. The tracks are real tracks from the RAC rally and have a changeable road. Sometimes you ride on tarmac and the other time on mud.

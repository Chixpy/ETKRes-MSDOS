If you"ve played any of the Bust-A-Move games, you"ll know what you"re in for with Scrambled Eggs. (Check the screenshot to see what I mean.) The game is basically the same as the classic Bust-A-Move games, except with annoying sound effects. (Barnyard sounds? Why?!) But the game is still quite well done, with nice graphics and responsive controls.

The first adventure game Mastertronic released is one of the most difficult adventures ever, with its extremely unforgiving puzzles and frequent deaths.

For killing the king"s guards, you have been sentenced to the Demon"s Forge, a deadly maze you must get out to earn your freedom form the king. Puzzles are logical, but as I said they are very difficult, so be warned.

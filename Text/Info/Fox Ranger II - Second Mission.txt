An alien organism has infiltrated Earth"s atmosphere and sunk deep into the ocean. Eventually, it grew and spread over the planet. A large-scale war between humans and aliens began. A lone Fox Ranger pilot is sent on his fighter spacecraft to an alien-controlled zone in attempt to single-handedly win the war.

Unlike its predecessor, Fox Ranger II incorporates three different shoot-em-up styles: the original horizontal one, vertical, and chase-view 3D. Stages may belong to any of these different styles and switch to another one following a boss fight. Weapon and power-up system, however, remain the same regardless of the perspective, with regular upgrades and up to three special weapons that can be stored and switched between.

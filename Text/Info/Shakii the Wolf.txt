In this cartoony arcade platformer, the player gets to control Shakii the wolf (who looks more like a fox, no kidding!). Shakii was the ruler of the peaceful kingdom of Shake (how original!) until the evil, almost invincible Lion Warrior called Midnight Sword appeared, plunging the land of Shake into an abyss of chaos and darkness. Now, it is upto Shakii to gather his powers and prepare for a final showdown with Midnight Sword.

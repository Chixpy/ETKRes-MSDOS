Pac-man, an arcade classic finds a new form in this very cute clone. CD-Man features 5 different worlds to pass each having nicely-drawn graphics in high-res EGA mode and therefore a new character, "The Snoofer" which was not available in version 1.5 (instead of it you were playing with your old pal). 

Created by two Swedish authors, Atilla Biro and Anders Moree.

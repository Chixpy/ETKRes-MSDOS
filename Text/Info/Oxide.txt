Beautiful futuristic letalka overhead view. Particular story, apparently, there is only entertaining, but it is the standard gameplay. fly forward, turn back can not, but can a little "pulled back." Exterminating armada of enemy aircraft and other flying different types of widgets (destroy all entirely optional and hardly at all), dodging sent them to us bullets and missiles, collect bonuses that fall from killed enemies or just hang in the air, and sometimes meet bosses. else to say nothing special. Is not that the graphics are really very good - this is a very late game times DOS"a, so here we are expected to fine-drawn enemies and spread the bottom varied landscapes, the shadow cast by the aircraft and superbly animated explosions, in short, watch what is happening visually very nice. Add to this the dynamic gameplay - and get an excellent evening entertainment. But, good or bad, no matter what a great game can not claim. PS: The game in Spanish, but the text in it quite a bit.

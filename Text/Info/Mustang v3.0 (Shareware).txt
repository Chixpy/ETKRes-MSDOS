In this game, the player flies a type of plane called the "Mustang".

This plane was used in World War II and is fairly easy to fly.

Using the Mustang, the player fights his way through an increasingly difficult array of evil enemy fighter planes and larger enemy bombers.
    
Throughout the never ending mission, the Mustang can augment its arsenal by picking up special gifts that float down the screen.

Come to think of it, Three is actually a very fitting name for a Columns clone. After all, as soon as there are three stones of the same color in a row, they vanish. And a Columns clone is what this game is, nothing more, nothing less.

Columns clones are rarely spartanic, neither is Three. You can choose between three difficulty settings, four ambiences (mine, summer, fruits, and no-sense), four songs (theme, rock, no-sense, and fourth), and even three sets of sound effects!

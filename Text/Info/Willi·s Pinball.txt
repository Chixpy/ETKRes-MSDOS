One of the earliest promotional games by ComAd, developed for Germany"s software superstore bhv in 1992.Willi"s Pinball is an okay pinball game with the same trappings as most other pinball games, except that you can forget any realism in this one because the ball behaves with hardly any nod to real-world physics. Aside from bhv ads within the game, there is really nothing in Willi"s Pinball that sets it apart from numerous other pinball games. Sure, it"s free, but a lot of freeware are far better coded than this as you can tell from the site ;) Not recommended, unless you simply must have every pinball game ever made.

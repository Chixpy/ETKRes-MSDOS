The Eight Accumulators is a Keen 4 levelpack that explains what happens on Commander Keen"s journey home after he saves the Universe from his arch nemesis Mortimer McMire during Battle of the Brains. The mod was constructed by Bubbatom with a fair bit of help from Ceilick , Mink and Gridlock. Bubbatom began working on the levelpack during mid 2011.

The story continues on from the Battle of the Brains ending. After saving the Universe from near destruction, Commander Keen heads home for dinner and a good night"s sleep. But also on board the Bean with Bacon Megarocket are his friends, Spot, Princess Lindsey, The Oracle Janitor and Lt. Barker who he must return to they"re respective planets before he returns to Earth. Lt. Barker is dropped at Vorticon VI before Keen flies onward to Gnosticus IV. Once there, as the crew are stepping onto the planets surface a big explosion errupts. The team follow falling debris to the Oracle where they find scorch marks on the Oracle, none of the Council Members that guard the Oracle and strangley none of the eight batteries usually in the battery compartment. Keen then sets out to find the missing Council members and The Eight Accumulators.

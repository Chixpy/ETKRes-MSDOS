"It was sometime in the 1960"s, we sat down in front of a strange contraption that resembled what we now call a television set. We turned the power switch to the on position. After a few moments which seemed more like an eternity, a faint picture slowly and mysteriously appeared on the crude television sets picture tube. Then we heard the words ""Space...the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise..."" emit from the tiny little speaker of this TV contraption. Who were these strange looking people? What did those first words that we all heard mean? Did any of us really know that we were watching the beginning of something that would touch our hearts along with many generations to come. Now we know that these first few words would more appropriately be ""This is the LEGEND of the starship Enterprise..."" Sit back, reminisce, and come join us in our REALM and explore our salute to the courageous crew of the LEGENDARY Enterprise.

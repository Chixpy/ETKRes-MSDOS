As its name implies, Triangle Tetris is based on the popular video game Tetris, in which the player controls falling pieces made of square blocks to make them fit together compactly. Triangle Tetris has a twist: the pieces are made up of interlocking triangular "blocks" rather than square ones. The pieces range in size from three triangular "blocks" to seven. As a piece falls down the screen, you may move it left or right using the arrow keys. You can rotate it 60 degrees clockwise by pressing the "C" key, or counterclockwise by pressing the "X" key. The space bar rotates the piece 180 degrees.

Bruno Vasto, a madman, has stolen the experimental SF-2 stealth fighter and threatens to blow up Washington D.C.!  It"s up to you to infiltrate Vasto"s organization and retrieve the fighter to save the world.  It"s all in a day"s work for David Wolf: Secret Agent.

David Wolf: Secret Agent was an experiment by Dynamix, not only as a self-published company, but also to merge digitized cinematic cutscenes with bitmap and 3D animation to create a better "interactive movie".  Four 3-D action simulations are the heart of the game: HangGliding (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Sportscar driving (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Fighter Simulation (with a machine gun and a missle launcher mounted to the front), and Skydiving (no machine gun).  The player follows along with the story for a few minutes, then is attacked and must outwit his opponents to live.

David Wolf serves as an interesting predecessor to the cinematic games Rise of the Dragon and Heart of China that Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye were trying to make.

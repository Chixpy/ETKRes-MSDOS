The game involves a lot and has some mad replay value. The object is to get the highest score possible, and there are a couple ways to do this. The screen advances by itself, and you use the control key to jump and try to stay high on the bricks. The higher you are, the more points you will get. There are bonuses all throughout the level and level completion bonuses to increase your score. Be careful, though, because if you don"t reach the end before time is up, you lose!

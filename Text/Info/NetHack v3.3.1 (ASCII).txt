Despite it"s name, this game does NOT involve any type of computer "hacking". It"s actually my favorite "Roguelike" game. While it may take awhile to learn all of the different commands, the game itself is very deep and involving. Plus, it"s different each time you play. Unlike most Roguelikes, Nethack also features optional VGA graphics. (Check "em out in the screenshot. To learn how to get VGA graphics in Nethack, read our FAQ!) This is one of the few games that I come back to play over and over, so I suggest you try it! (Check nethack.org for special Windows/Linux/WindowsCE/other versions!)

Real Fighter takes the questionable honour of being Korea"s first 3D fighting game. Like most early specimen in the subgenre, Real Fighter is heavily inspired by Virtua Fighter, but the technical execution is worse than even the most sluggish home port of Sega"s genre primus. The characters are so blocky they"re barely even recognizable as such, and the controls feel as stiff as it gets. There"s not a lot of playing modes to chose from, either, with "player vs player" and "player vs com" as the only options.

Things are not as bad as with, say, Softry"s first attempt at a 2D fighter (Cheonha Mujeok), as Real Fighter is actually somewhat playable, and there can be some fun to be had with the game. It just pales so much next to any competition available at the time. [Hardcore Gaming 101]

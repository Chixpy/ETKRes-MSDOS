After the failure of Cheonha Mujeok, Baek Namkil left Softry to form his own company, Yeonwoo Soft, taking the entire graphics team with him. They then teamed up with Deca Team"s programmers to make a much more playable fighting game. Mutant DNA is actually one of the better DOS fighters out there, despite the limited cast of only 8 characters plus 1 boss and occasional glitches.

Yeonwoo Soft started a number of projects after Mutant DNA, but this remained their only release. [Hardcore Gaming 101]

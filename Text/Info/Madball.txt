This is a simple nerve racking game of dexterity and coordination.  The object is to move your piece across the screen and out the door on the right side without getting hit by a bouncing ball and without touching the walls.

You start by choosing a level of play from 1 to 4 with 1 being the most difficult.  You are given three pieces to play with.
   
Pressing the space bar places a piece on the board and positions a "door" on the right edge which is your way out.
   
The game starts with one bouncing ball and adds a ball each time you make it across the board.  The highest number of balls officially recorded to date is 23......

You control the movement of your piece using the numeric keypad.

Metal Marines Master Edition contains almost the same gameplay as the original Metal Marines. However gone is the storyline, as Master Edition puts the player into instant combat. Opponents can be chosen from a list of AI generals or connected to by using modem or LAN connections. Not only that, but this time it"s FASTER real time combat. You won"t have time to sit there and coordinate your strategy. The missiles and the marines will be landing any minute! Furthermore the game has been enhanced for windows and takes advantage of dragging objects from one window to another in order to make attacks as well as providing more control over metal marines in enemy camps. A variety of landscape and over 20 detailed command scenarios will give you plenty of landscape to rage with war.

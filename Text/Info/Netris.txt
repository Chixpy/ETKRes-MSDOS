Netris takes the classic Tetris arcade game and adds several new features to create a new, unique form of entertainment. The Netris playing area is a 22 row by 10 column grid. Like Tetris, pieces consisting of four adjacent blocks fall from the top of the screen until they come to rest at the top of the block pile. By rotating the pieces and moving them side to side, the player can control where the pieces land and how they fit into the pile. When a complete row of the grid is filled, the blocks of that row are removed from the pile. Every so often, a special piece will appear at the top of the screen and begin falling. There are five such pieces: Small Bombs, Big Bombs, Guns, Mashers, and Inverters. Each piece has its own unique characteristics.

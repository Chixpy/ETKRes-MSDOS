In Dactylus - a parallax-scrolling fantasy shooter - you slip into the role of Yarin, a dragon-rider. Evil forces destroyed his village and killed his family. Now it"s up to you to take revenge.

Awaiting the player are 6-level-parallax scrolling, animated enemies, huge bosses, special weapons (like dragonfire and magical lightning) and multiple-choice conversations.

"The Martian Colony Water Simulator is the product of the 1989 Engineering Design Student Challenge, a competition recently held at Purdue University, sponsored by the Engineering Student Council and the General Electric corporation. Students formed teams with members from a variety of engineering disciplines, with the purpose of creating a general plan for a manned outpost on the planet Mars, and then selecting a particular subsystem of such a colony for in-depth examination, such as power systems, construction, materials, transportation, and so forth. My team after much deliberation selected the water acclamation and distribution subsystem for concentrated study, and the Water Simulator is the centerpiece of a project that received first place in the competition.

Though full appreciation of the simulation may be difficult without the text of the competition report, I"ve chosen to release the program for the benefit of any interested in the subject material and/or the competition.The entire empirical basis of the simulation cannot be detailed here, but I"ll try to make clear the purpose and function of the simulation, and how the user can manipulate and interpret its various elements."

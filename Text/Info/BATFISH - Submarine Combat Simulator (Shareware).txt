"Congratulations, Captain! CINCLANTFLT has just issued new orders. You have just been promoted out from behind your desk at Fleet Operations Headquarters. With no actual experience in submarine command, fleet operations or combat strategy, you have been selected by the review board as being more than qualified to fill the vacancy. You will take command of a Fleet Class Submarine without delay (or any training).

The submarine you now command is a generic collection of all the best attributes of several different classes of submarines. General "housekeeping" duties on board are performed by your junior officers (the little lackeys), removing the need for you to worry about them. However, you command the submarine and are responsible for anything that may endanger her. For example, the engine room staff will charge your batteries when surfaced without being told or the torpedo room crews will reload torpedo tubes when they are empty (providing you have closed the outer door on that tube).

Major Electric Corporation and Hydro Dynamics Inc. constructed your vessel at the Fleet yards in one of the secret costal Naval Yards. Initial testing and work-ups indicate that your vessel meets all operational requirements laid out in the contract. However, the manufacture indicates that your submarine MAY dive below the contract test depth. Care should be taken below this depth because you may damage your vessel to the point where recovery is not possible."

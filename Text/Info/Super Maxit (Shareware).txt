Super Maxit is a strategy board game. There are several board styles that the player can select. Each board consists of a series of raised tiles that contain either a positive or a negative number. Using the left or right arrow keys the player moves to the desired number tile, then presses enter to select it. The players score is then increased or decreased (black numbers are positive, red numbers are negative) by the value of the selected tile. The computer then moves vertically to select a tile. The game ends when either the player or the computer can not take a number tile. The player with the higher score at end of the game wins.

The scubaman"s quest is apparently to collect treasure and avoid angry sharks and other angry sea creatures. You control your little scubaguy with the arrow keys as you swim through the underwater level collecting gold and "rare marine creatures". It"s a decent little action game with not a whole lot of depth.

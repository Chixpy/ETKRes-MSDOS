Humanspies have found out that the aliens have rebuilt their forces and are planning to attack again. The Incredible Bikester must go to the alien world and stop them.

The object of the game is to jump over rocks and tires to destroy enemy bikes and remote jets. When your score reaches 50 you win. Watch out for remote jets because they shoot lasers at you!

You are a member of the Imperial Navy, eager to fight the Rebel Alliance and other scum to strengthen the rule of Darth Vader and the Emperor.

The follow up to X-Wing is a space combat simulation set in the Star Wars universe. There are 7 campaigns, taking in over 50 missions. You often have wingmen who can be given orders to help you out. The detailed storyline is driven by cutscenes. You will fly a variety of craft from the lowly Tie Fighter to the speedy Tie Interceptor to the high-powered Tie Advanced. On each of these, balancing engine/laser/shield ratios in real time is crucial to getting the most power and safety.

This compilation includes the campaigns from the original game Star Wars: TIE Fighter, the three campaigns from the add-on Star Wars: TIE Fighter - Defender of the Empire and also three new, never before released campaigns in a second add-on called Enemies of the Empire. In total there are more than 100 missions to fly and survive.

In addition to the new missions, there are also some technical improvements to the game:

Improved screen resolution to SVGA (640*480)
Added new cut scenes
Full voice mission briefings and radio calls (the so called "Talkie" version)
Improved the interactive mission briefing

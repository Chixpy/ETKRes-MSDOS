Three Point Basketball is a simulation of the three point shooting contest, seen every year in the NBA All star game and other basketball contests. The game uses a mouse interface, where you determine the power and angle of your shot. Features include a tournament where you try to win the 3 point championship and a practice mode to work on your shots. The game parodies real players from the league, featuring an imaginary "ASBA" league which includes, Jordy Michales, Mystic Johnson and Larry Fowl. Quirky commentary and sound effects add to the excitement.

After defeating Lakum the first time, Ahib has been a bit careless about his oil fields. What he didn"t see, was, that an army of Lakum"s people has built a bunch of derricks in order to steal his oil again.

Can you help Ahib destroy those derricks in order to save his fields and get his oil back? This time Ahib"s armed with bombs, and there"s no mercy for whoever might be on that derrick, Ahib will blow up.

What you have got to do in this game, is to blow up every platform"s connection point in order to destroy a derrick. Those connection points hold the platforms together, and when you destroy them all, the derrick
is history.

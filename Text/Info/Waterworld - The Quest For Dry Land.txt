As in the film of the same name, the melting of the polar ice caps has created a flooded world. Worse, it"s a world where law and order has broken down, where gangs of mercenaries and tribalists are constantly on the attack. As leader of a group of survivors, you must complete 22 missions of real-time strategy.

Some missions are attack based, and some are purely defensive. Flame-throwers, Molotov Cocktails and crossbows are among the 17 featured weapons. Steal weaponry and improves the defences of your fortress to survive. Resource management across missions is another key element. The storyline is flowed by cut-scenes involving actors from the film.

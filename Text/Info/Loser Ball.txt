Welcome to the game of Loser Ball. The game action centers around some slime blobs set up on a 9x9 checkerboard. There are 18 computer players with individualized intelligences and tendencies, ranging from the Loser Ball champions to just plain losers, and a human player roster that can hold the records of up to 100 people. There is also a tournament mode which pits 8 players against each other in a fight over the coveted Loser Ball Title.

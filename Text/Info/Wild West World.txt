Wild West World is a fun, original, and detailed strategy game set in the USA"s famed Gold Rush period.Designed by the same designers as The Manager, one of the most complex football simulations ever made, Wild West World tells the story of Jack Putter, a cowboy and wannabe farmer who just moved to a new town. As Jack, your goal is to become one of the town"s most respected citizens - and finding gold nuggets in the process can"t hurt. 

The game gives you 20 years to accomplish your career goals, with each turn representing one day. Your first tasks are to hire a few farmhands, buy horses, seeds, and cattle, and perhaps borrow some start-up capital from a local bank. In addition to dealing with robbers and thieves, you have to deal with many other random events including Indian assaults, floods, locusts, and many more. At all times, you must take into account dozens of factors in making decisions, because the computer-controlled farmers are not stupid. 

On top of the turn-based strategy gameplay, Wild West World includes a few action sequences such as the pistol duels to evoke the feel of the wild west and add variety to the game. If you find that the game is too difficult, you can reduce the difficulty level - there are five in all. As a "wild west business simulation," there is very little that is wrong with Wild West World. I found some pictures too grainy or too small to see, but that is a small nitpick. If you like The Lost Dutchman Mine but found it too simple, Wild West World is right up your alley. Highly recommended to all wannabe cowboys everywhere.

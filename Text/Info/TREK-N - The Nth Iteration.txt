"TREK-N is ""the Nth iteration"" of the classic Star Trek game started by Mike Mayfield and others clear back in 1972.

The goal of the game is to rescue Tribbles from the Klingons. Along the way you will also need to occasionally pickup dilithium crystals to refuel the matter/antimatter reaction chamber."

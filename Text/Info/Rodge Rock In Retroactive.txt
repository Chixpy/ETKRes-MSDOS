Side-scrolling shooter. You are Rodge Rock and must collect power-ups and shoot everything in sight.

Just a beautiful arcade platformer. Playing for a hefty man with a black crest on the top, a black vest and with a huge gun at the ready, jump through the various levels, kill the various monsters (especially anyone looking seriously is not among them), collect the standard bonuses. More about this game has nothing to say (except that note a very bright and attractive graphics). But it was his standard game and wonderful - for me it is actually a platform ideal: a complete lack of plot, charismatic hero, thoroughly "soaked" the spirit of the 90"s (this guy just can not love pizza, soda, hard rock and slot machines), not too hard gameplay. In a word - cool, but fun to play, not to describe.

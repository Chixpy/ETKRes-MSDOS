In this solitaire game, cards are laid out in a row.  The object of the game is to pile all of the cards on top of one another.  You can move a card or pile of cards either one or two spaces to the left when the card you are placing it on matches its suit or value.  As cards are moved to the left, new cards are dealt onto the right side of the row from the deck.  This implementation of the game allows the player to choose from a starting row of thirteen, ten or seven cards, and it also keeps track of ten high scores.

OUTLAND is a small guided missile shoot"em up game. Nothing too serious. It is just supposed to be fun. There have been several very famous games with a similar type play. It does take a little from each of them. It is very simplistic in it"s use of keys, so kids will find it very easy to play. They will also enjoy steering the projectile. Guess what? Those are the same reason adults will like it.

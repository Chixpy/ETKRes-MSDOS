"The object of Nancy Arno"s Tetris is to complete as many horizontal lines as possible by rotating and maneuvering up to 18 uniquely challenging pieces, one at a time. With every horizontal line completed, the player becomes one step closer to the next level. There are nine levels total.

Each piece starts at the top of the game board and falls downward until it lands on either the bottom of the game board, or on top of a previously played piece. A horizontal line must stretch both sides of the game board before it is counted and removed, causing all of the pieces above it to fall. The game is over when the entire game board becomes cluttered with pieces and no more lines can be made."

If you"ve ever played Dr Mario on any Nintendo system, you"ll find DoubleLink"s gameplay to be quite similar. Pretty much exactly the same, actually. The object is to maneuver different colored falling "pills" and match up the colors to eliminate the same-colored germs. It plays fine, and looks acceptable, but really adds nothing new, so if you"re looking for a Dr Mario type game this might fit the bill for you.

"You will be controlling the character of Captain Kirk, and will also control his crew member"s actions as well. Armed with your fifty watt killo zap phaser taser lazer, and controlling your very own state of the art hovomatic hover chair that floats you approximately twelve centimeters above the ground (great for transportation purposes, yet with slight clearance problems had revolutionized the field by replacing the wheelchair, your arms don"t get as tired as they used to).

I hope you enjoy this game and have fun...

May the force be with you and remember Luke, Vader is your father and Leia is your sister..."

The rules of Life are ridiculously simple. There is a cell map, which consists of matrix of cells. Each cell may be on (alive) or off (dead)
    
Each cell has eight neighbor squares: four orthogonal and four diagonal.   

For each generation, the future of each cell is determined by the two simple rules:

1st: If the cell is alive and it has either two or three alive neighbors, it will stay alive in the next generation, otherwise it will die.

2nd: If the cell is dead, it will turn alive in the next generation, if it has exactly three alive neighbours, otherwise it remains dead.

That"s all. So, what"s the big deal? Well, try the program and you will be amazed how many variety of Life forms these simple rules can generate!
                                                                          
The game of Life is the creation of John Horton Conway, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge. These rules were first published in the Scientific American in 1970.

Rarity of the Spanish game in a futuristic style and without a specific scene. We play for some big-headed creature (smiling face on the legs), which destroys the other creatures, moving across the screen. Each level consists of multiple screens, but there is no scroll bar, the screen returns to previous impossible. The hero has a few lives, it is possible to collect bonuses in the form of the letter E; any contact with the enemy instantly ends in death. The enemies in the game very original: there is, say, ghosts, and there are some incredible "balls on the platforms." Murder is shot from a distance, the number of charges is not limited to, all killed with a single shot. Passage of each level is limited by time. Sometimes suddenly opens the bonus level with a completely different gameplay, for example, there is a level-style Space Invaders : need, driving a spaceship, moving horizontally to shoot hanging above a monster, like an octopus with kind eyes, and dodge his shots (temporary restriction at levels even more stringent.) graphics in the game - only CGA, backgrounds almost there, but still some good traced elements of the environment are present, enemies die with the "explosion", which are also depicted beautifully. Perspective review - formal side, but the hero in the screen can move in all directions. The game features a breakneck pace (in fact, there should always move and shoot in all directions, thus avoiding contact with enemies) and objectively high complexity. Currently Cefalus is a huge value for collectors because of their rarity, but for sure will be of interest and fans complex "fast" arcades. PS: The game in Spanish, but the text is only on the menu and short messages.

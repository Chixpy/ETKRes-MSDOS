Welcome to the Terradyne World. The Terradyne RPG is a game that was written in response to the overall poor quality of the majority of role playing games on the market. I was always disappointed when a good role playing game would come to an end.  Why couldn"t someone make a game so that you could add-on modules and campaigns along with all sorts of medieval weapons and fantastic magic?  This would allow you to continiously upgrade and improve the game while still providing new adventures and artifacts for the players to conquer and destroy.  This is my attempt in the design of fantasy role playing game for this type of unending supply of material for the gamer.  Terradyne was written for a 286,386 or higher class machine with at least EGA.

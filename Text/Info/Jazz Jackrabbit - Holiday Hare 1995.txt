Played all six episodes of Jazz Jackrabbit and still can"t get enough? Then play this special "Christmas" edition of Jazz. Featuring four levels with new graphics and sound, including a rap version of Little Drummer Boy.

You still have your favorite weapons: RF missiles, toasters, blasters, and launcers, but sadly, there are no bosses in the game. This game is freely downloadable on most freeware/shareware sites. 

Also, there are three new episodes, which are not included in the game unless you order the Jazz Jackrabbit CD-ROM.

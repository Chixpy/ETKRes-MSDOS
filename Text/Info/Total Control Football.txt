Total Control Football offers a managerial approach to American Football simulations. You have been just named general manager of an NFL team in major problems, and its your job to take it to the top. This means both winning games and turning a profit. You"ll be able to manage every aspect of your organization, you"ll be in control of drafting players, set salaries, create plays, and even set the prices of hotdogs and other nuisances!

The games can be auto played or you can jump in the coaches seat and call the plays. Also available is a small arcade mode in which you control the action.

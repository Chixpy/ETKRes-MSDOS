Aerial combat over Europe in World War II.  Man your Royal Marine Spitfire and defend London during the Blitz.

One of the first flight simulators on the PC, in the development (or rather, to port) which involved Sid Meier. action takes place during World War II, you play as a pilot of the Royal Air Force and guide aerial combat with the German air force in the skies over London, in France during the occupation, Malta, France, after the Allied landings and so on - all in the game fifteen different scenarios (but that some scripts, no campaign, no). Control of the game and the gameplay, perhaps, is not particularly difficult, and generally well developed, but the game still incredibly difficult - primarily because of the really old graphics (for its time, although it is still at least not bad), which sometimes can not tell exactly where on the screen (the form of the game in the first person) is the enemy plane. Although still in the game, there are quite distinguishable dashboard displaying your fuel level, ammunition (all in the game of course), and the height of the motor. Thus, the historical value of the game - is undeniable and irrefutable, real today - somewhat doubtful , but still a real bearded oldgeymeram, which some accident are not yet familiar with the Spitfire Ace , like her for sure. After all, this is the most that on is a living history of computer games.

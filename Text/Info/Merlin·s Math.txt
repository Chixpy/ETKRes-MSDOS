Merlin"s Math is a decent math program designed to teach young kids the basics of algebra.Designed mainly as a promotional product for Penguin chocolate, the game is much shorter than a typical edutainment title, although it does have enough colorful cartoons to keep kids happy while they figure out the answers to straightforward, multiple-choice math questions (e.g. what is the result of 5 + 7 ?). The game has a nice mouse-driven interface, which is quite rare for a 1992 education game. Overall, Merlin"s Math does not much variety of games, but it does the job of educating kids about basic math. For a more interesting and diverse program, check out the Super Solver series from the Learning Company instead.

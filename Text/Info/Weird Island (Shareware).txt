Weird Island is a first-person perspective adventure game. The plot involves inheriting an island (something tells me it"s a WEIRD island) and so you go to check it out, and shenanigans ensue! It uses a point and click interface and has decent graphics. You"ll encounter plenty of obscure puzzles and ... uh, weird stuff during your adventure. I"m tired of writing this description. If you like adventure games, just download it already will ya? :)

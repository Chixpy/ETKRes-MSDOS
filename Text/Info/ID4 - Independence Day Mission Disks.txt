Trendmasters made a line of toys for the blockbuster summer movie hit ID-4 Independence Day. The Twentieth Century Fox film stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid and Judd Hirsh. 

Included in the ID-4 Independence Day toy line are giant alien figures that activate by sound and motion; alien action figures; movie action hero figures accessorized with battle gear, back packs, spring loaded weapons and armor. Also included are the F-18 fighter jet and an alien attacker ship with four firing missles, two dropping bombs, action sound, lights and a removable pilot. 

Every action figure and playset comes with a thematically-linked, interactive, IBM compatible "Mission Disk." There were 11 different missions in all. 

Mission Disk 2: Alien Science Officer - you look out of the eyes of an alien science officer preparing the exoskeletal suits of his brethren for the invasion of earth. By analyzing the genes of native animals you"ll figure out what will be needed for your soldiers on Earth. The information you"ll receive will be recorded in colored crystals. To build the device you have to move these crystals into a device that will check them for cross-compatibility. When you find two crystals that are compatible they will become the same color and be send to build a powersuit. 

Mission Disk 6: Technical Expert David Levinson - you pilot a alien space fighter craft as it softens up earth defenses for its mother ship. Using the mouse to move your craft left and right you will fire upon incoming jet fighters by clicking to shoot your deadly ray beam. The goal is to destroy parts of the city beneath you, which can be accomplished by charging your beam, by holding your click, until it is powerful enough to take down bits of cityscape. However the incoming pilots, while easy to destroy, are numerous, high on ammo, and perfectly willing to use their own fuselages as a weapon against you.

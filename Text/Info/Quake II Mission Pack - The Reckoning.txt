The first official mission pack for Quake II is a extension of the original, offering more weapons and opponents along with plenty of solid single-player and deathmatch levels. 

The story starts off with the player being part of an elite commando force that must infiltrate a hostile alien city. Once inside, the player must scour industrial landscapes, crawl through waterways and air ducts, navigate treacherous canyons teeming with vicious mutants, stow away on an alien spacecraft and destroy the enemy"s secret moon base. 

New enemies include Gekks, the Repair Bot which has the ability to awaken dead Strogg, new types of guards, an enhanced Tank, and an Iron Maiden equipped with guided missiles.  New weapons include the Phalynx Particle Cannon, the Ion Ripper, the Trap, and and a power-up that increases rate of fire by four times.

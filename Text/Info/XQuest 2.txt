Definitely one of the most least-known gems ever, this is a flawless conversion of Crystal Quest, the Macintosh cult classic.The premise of the game is simple: with your mouse, gobble up as many gems as possible while avoiding the nasties, then make for the exit. Levels get difficult quickly, and the game has that elusive "just one more level..." quality. I remember playing this for hours on a friend"s Mac :)

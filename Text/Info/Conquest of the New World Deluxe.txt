Like the original Conquest of The New World, the Deluxe Edition lets you control one of 6 different nations (five European and the High Natives) in their attempt to colonize and conquer a "new" continent.

The game is turn-based, and combat is a mini-game taking place on a 3x5 square battlefield where victory can be achieved by killing all enemy troops or capturing the enemy"s flag. The gameworld is represented in an isometric point of view with three-dimensional terrain features.

Colonies consist of a Colony Centre, exerting an area of control within which all buildings must be placed. Most buildings, including the Colony Centre can be upgraded, adding to their production capabilities. Resources are used for building and upgrading, or can be traded with the natives, other nations, or your mother country.

The Deluxe Edition adds several new features to the game. Primarily it adds the option to create and play scenarios and customizing the world. In addition, nations now have different bonuses, several special resources and discoveries have been added, and you can form trade alliances with other nations.

Victory conditions are customizable, so the game can be played as a pure conquest game with the last nation standing, being the winner, or as a more peaceful race for victory points to a pre-determined score.

Conquest Of The New World is a game much similar to Civilization in some ways. You start the game with your ship. You will have to make landfall with your units and get contact with the natives. You can either attack them or start to trade with them similar to things like in Civilization or Colonization. 

The control of your units is a new way of controlling. You drag an arrow from your unit to where you want it to move and moves automatically.

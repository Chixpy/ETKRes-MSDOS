You are brave warrior Armorik, seeking to immortalize your name in the book of Viking legends. Luckily for you, the great god Thor has reviewed your application and mulled over your case. Thor agrees to reward you with eternal fame... provided that you single-handedly conquer the eight territories of the North.  

Your conquests can be tackled in any order. Each location is composed of multiple interlinked screens, and is named for its prevailing environment: Cemetery, Fire, Mountain, Cave, Manor House, Ice, Forest, and Castle. Armed only with throwing knives, Armorik must explore each region thoroughly, collect treasure guarded by fiends and natural hazards, find the hidden key, and reach the exit unharmed - all in less than two and a half minutes.

This strict time limit, along with quick enemies that respawn every few seconds, multiple monsters and turrets that aim at you from different angles, and every hit being instantly lethal (requiring you to restart the chosen level) - all combine to create an arcade-style platform game where survival requires memorization, quick wits, agility and patience.

This game is not listed on any global database of games. On it there is little mention of the web. It is unknown, and the modern world seems to prefer to simply disown her. But this does not mean it does not exist. It is - just many, many years was not available to people. This arcade game - a platformer with a side view. Do I need a game like this story? No. So here it is not. A general description of what is happening: we play for the Vikings in different locations. Nine levels, all of them are available right from the main menu of the game - which is more like it, and select. Neither level is different, but each - more than exotic. How do you, for example, ice or fire wasteland? A cemetery, Forest? It"s all it will be. At every level - their own, very special enemies (although some sort may be repeated), of which the flying demons, spitting fire, snakes, creepy-looking guys big noses and dark all the others, the list is long, such a variety of monsters should look for another. Each level consists of multiple screens. Time for completion of the level (the whole level, and not the particular screen) is limited not only cruel and ruthless in: just a few minutes. Can not stop for a second - not only because the timer is ticking, but also because the enemies in a particular point, even being killed, revivals. only kind of bonuses - bags of money remaining in place of some (not all) types of enemies killed . Apparently, they"re going to just for the big accounts following: because no "lives" in the game, any contact with any enemy instantly ends the loss, save the game, of course, impossible. management very difficult. For example, Armorica able to climb stairs and jump on the objects / jump the gap, but this button only works when it is close to the place where the jump is possible (in other words, there is not even the semblance of a running start), and immediately adjacent to such places always somehow or the enemies themselves, or any shells that are allowed. So often a matter of survival will depend on the accuracy of the fingers is not the response that a second, and a tenth part of it. most "powerful" game of the supported graphics cards - color CGA-palette, then there are four colors. But, first, draw all still healthy, and secondly - that"s really something in this game on the schedule just do not pay attention - it"s just physically impossible. Compared with the adventures of Armorica, if not all, the vast majority seem simple arcade games, and toys. Game in any case is not suitable for entertainment - for focused and long development, it can rob you of billions of nerve cells, but if you overpower at least some of the local levels, we gain a hardened arcade, you will not be afraid nothing. This is the "hardcore and MegaDrive" in its purest form. Important note - the game, despite the monstrous complexity, it is adequate to the player. Before starting to tell you about how to manage, and if not to start a new game, it will show a consistent videoprohozhdenie all nine levels. Good or not - you decide, but it is still worthwhile to see at least one episode of passage for understanding the tactics, for without it nothing can and will fail.

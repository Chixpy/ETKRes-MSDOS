Rotating falling blocks in a set way is the aim in this follow-up to Tetris and Welltris, but the concept here is very different. The falling shapes represent parts of people"s faces, which must be arranged and rotated to form complete human-looking faces, ideally matching that of a famous person or other face. You can use a paint package to draw a face to import, which each of the 60 faces has appropriate background music. There are 10 difficulty levels and an optional head-to-head mode.

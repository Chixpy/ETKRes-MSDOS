BRAINdead2 is a shareware offering that features two distinct games in a single program - a hidden tile match game that tests memory skills and a visible tile match game that pits the player against the clock.

The game was originally written because there are so few PC games that our five year old could play without help. Kids do really well with this game. As for adults - the name says it all!

"Dr. Peter Jones and Von Hough Dietnitch never got along well. Beginning in college, their rivalry continued well into their careers at NorsBright Technical Labs. But when Dr. Jones invented a new rocket engine that was better than anything ever imagined, it was more than Dietnitch could take. He kidnapped Dr. Jones and imprisoned him in his heavily armored Iron Island Fortress.

It is up to Sgt. Duffy to penetrate the fortess in the space-plane and rescue Dr. Jones. Good luck!"

Stocks & Bonds is an excellent PC port of 3M/Avalon Hill"s board game of the same name that remains to this day one of the best tabletop stock market simulations ever made.Starting with $5,000 in funds, your job is to invest in the game?s 10 securities, buying and selling each year (= 1 round) to become the wealthiest stockholder in the game. As in the actual board game, you can compete with up to 8 players. One of the more interesting features of the board game original is the unique calculator which will tell you if you have had a Happy Monday or a Black Friday. This has been implemented quite effectively in the PC version. 

Given its age (first released in 1981), Stocks & Bonds is admittedly a primitive simulation by today?s standards, with simple gameplay and little variety. But still, for a game coded in BASIC it?s quite good ? stock movements and impact of the bear and bull markets are realistic enough to keep me interested for a while, at least. And fans of the board game classics will be delighted with this rare PC version. Recommended if you enjoy stock market simulations in general.

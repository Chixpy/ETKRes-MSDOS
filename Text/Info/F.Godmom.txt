F.Godmom is a platform game, featuring a fairy godmother as the protagonist. All the fairy godmothers have been captured, and only you are left to save them. On each level, the player needs to collect all the tokens, find the key and get to the exit. Monsters kill the fairy if they come in contact with her. The player"s only weapon is a magic wand that can be used to transform objects. The player first uses the wand on any object to acquire a "wand pattern", then he can transform anything (walls, ladders, monsters...) into said object. This can be used to create ladders to travel, get rid of monsters etc., though all transformed objects revert to their original form after a while. Some levels feature gray objects which cannot be affected by the wand.

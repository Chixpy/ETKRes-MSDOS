"Yes.... it"s those aliens again. Funny how they seem to get around these days. Anyway, their latest ploy is to construct a giant MEGALASER using Praseodymium crystals.

Their home planet being devoid of any useful mineral resources, they scavenge the galaxy for these crystals, hopping from planet to planet without much success, until finally they spy a glittering light coming from the 3rd planet in System 45D-0xff...

Yep, some dingo on Earth has left hundreds of Praseodymium crystals lying around the place.

So we"re faced with a possible crisis situation unless someone can clean up those crystals before the aliens get them.

You boldly step forward and accept the task..."

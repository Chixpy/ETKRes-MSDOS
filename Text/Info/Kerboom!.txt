Kerboom! features a criminal who moves randomly across the top area of the screen, raining bombs down upon you.  All you have is your buckets of water to catch the bombs.

At the beginning of the game you have three (3) buckets of water to render-safe the falling bombs.  Every time you miss catching a bomb you lose one of your precious buckets. When all of your buckets are gone, the game is over.

For every 10,000 points of game play you will be awarded a spare bucket, which will replace any bucket you have lost, or any bucket you might lose in the future.  If you are
playing in extended mode (see below), then the bonuses are spaced every 5,000 points.

Evil Crypt is a graphical adventure game for the IBM PC. You MUST download this and give it a try. CGA or better! Classical! It is VERY addicting and is NOT at all easy to solve. It was originally written for the TRS-80 CoCo II. This game was a winner in a contest in 1985. It looks and feels EXACTLY like the CoCo game. Three very large levels to explore! Full of monsters and treasure! Enjoy!

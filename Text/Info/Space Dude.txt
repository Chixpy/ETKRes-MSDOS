Action and strategy put together in a strange little game. You play as Space Dude, a dorky teenager on a surf-board that must defend the Golden City from KingDorf and his armies of Hoppers.

The game features some strategical decisions, like choosing the missions you"ll perform (from a variety of options, like repair jobs, attacking or even capturing Hoppers).

After you choose your mission, you"ll surf to your destination and action sequences begin. The goal of the game is to rid the universe of KingDorf.

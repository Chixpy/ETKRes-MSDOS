It"s a educational Jump & Run Game f\u00fcr the company Danone. You play Daniel through big levels a little similar to Pitfall Mayan Adventure. In each level you must collect good food like bread, fish, grapes, etc. It"s good for your condition - you can jump higher and you can run faster. Then you have harmful food like cakes, ice and so on. It makes you fat and slow. The Oppenents can be defeat with lemons.

I think it"s a good game. The graphics are good and the gameplay is a little unique. 
Try it!

One Must Fall is an early beta version of the excellent fighting game One Must Fall: 2097.Interestingly, it is remarkedly different from the released version-- as the screenshot shows, it was originally developed as a side-scrolling karate game, with no signs of giant robots... hence, the absence of "2097" in the working title. Even at this early stage, the fluid animation and excellent fight controls are apparent. A good beta version that is surprisingly playable.

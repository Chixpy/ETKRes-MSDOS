You are Onesimus, a slave of Philemon. You want to escape from slavery and be free. For freedom you must go to Rome. There you must find the apostle Paul. He will teach you how to become a Christian. Only then will you discover true freedom.

This game uses the Jill of the Jungle engine. Just like in that game you must find keys to open doors, apples to maintain your health and knifes to ward off dangerous animals.

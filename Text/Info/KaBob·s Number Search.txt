"You are a guy from the long-lost island of Upiurs, and your name is KaBob. 40 years ago, when you were little, you told some of your friends that you were psychic, because you wanted to impress one of them, a really cute girl named Sheesh. Of course, you weren"t, so they didn"t believe you. They said that 40 years from then you would come across a computer game where you would have to guess a number. You said ""How do you know?"" and they replied ""We _ARE_ psychic."" 

Well, it"s 40 years from then, and sure enough, you came across this game that they were talking about. And also strange is that the same group of people were standing around you, watching, waiting for you to screw up and not guess the number. ""We"ll give you 6 tries,"" said Sheesh. ""If you don"t guess the number in those 6 tries, then we won"t believe you."" So they handed you the game and you started playing.

Good luck, and beware of the evil Run Time Monster."

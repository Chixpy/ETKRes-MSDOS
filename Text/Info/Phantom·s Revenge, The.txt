The Phantom"s Revenge and Castle Elsinore are two early piece of IF that are of very little value except for its age.The Phantom"s Revenge is riddled with below-average writing, inane puzzles, and inflexible parser that understands only the most basic verb-noun sentences. The plot doesn"t even make sense: the introduction tells of a prison that"s rumored to hold treasures guarded by a ghost, and invites you to explore it-- yet in the very first scene you find yourself *imprisoned* in a cell without a clue of why or how. The game would deserve complete anonymity if not for some logical puzzles that do require a modicum of thought. Don"t expect this game to be more than what it is: an Infocom wannabe that falls far off the mark. Castle Elsinore is slightly better than its cousin due to a more coherent plot, but still bogged down with obscure puzzles. Underrated, maybe, but certainly not far from the bottom of the heap.

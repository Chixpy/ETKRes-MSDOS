Jetpac PC is an excellent PC remake of Jetpac, one of the best action games made for the Spectrum ZX computer.Similar to good old Atari classics of yore, your goal in the game is simply to score as many points as possible. You do this by finding parts of your ship that are scattered around the level, reassembling them into one piece, then fueling it up and move on to the next screen where more alien weirdness awaits. 

You fly around the level with your jetpac, equipped only with the blue and purple death ray that shoots a thin line across half the screen. Even with limited weapon, your death ray is powerful: one hit is enough to finish all enemies. But like all good action games, killing enemies and building your ship aren"t the only ways to amass points. There is the obligatory array of cool but ultimately pointless bonus items you can grab, including colored diamonds, gold bars, space triangles, green jellybeans, and other random items. Of all these, the only important item you need are the fuel canisters, since you need 6 of them to fire your ship. 

Although the game gets a bit repetitive in higher levels as you run out of new enemies to battle or scenery to look at, Jetpac PC still has the same simple-yet-addictive quality that characterizes such classics as Joust. This excellent PC remake does justice to the 8-bit original, and showcases the zany and wacky talent that was Ultimate Play the Game"s hallmark. Two thumbs up, way up!

Already the fourth game in the series, Clonk 3 Radikal added many new elements to the game. One player can play predefined missions or try to achieve peaceful goals such as selling all the gold, rescuing the fluffy Wipfs or killing all the monsters. The former goals can also be pursued by 2 to 4 players cooperatively on one computer, or they can decide to play a melee round in which each player tries to do the other teams in.

Every single Clonk can be controlled by the player, in contrast to the group-wise controls of the predecessors. Clonks also learned to swim and dive, dig in different directions and build bridges. 4-Way scrolling allows for bigger scenarios filled with new raw materials and endangered by volcanoes, earthquakes and hostile creatures.

A variety of new buildings, weapons, materials, vehicles and weather conditions to help or hinder the players actions make the game more complex and put a heavier weight on strategic thinking than classic Clonk games.

The game also includes a mission editor, with which players can create their own scenarios by creating a landscape and defining every aspect including weather, initial property and goals.

Jim Kobbe"s Pool Game in 3D is a shareware, single player vs the computer pool game that is based on standard 8-ball pool. The graphics in this game are all of the "wire frame" variety and the game is entirely keyboard controlled.  The player can customise the style of game to be played. They can turn sound on or off, set the skill level of their computer opponent, and apply weighting factors to the type of shot favoured by the computer. Pool names such as Straight, End Kick, Side Bank and so on are given to various types of shot. Weighting factors for each type of shot can be set in the range 0, meaning that the shot will never be played by the computer, to 99 which means that this shot is most favoured.

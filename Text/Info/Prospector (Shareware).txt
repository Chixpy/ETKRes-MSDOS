Prospector takes place in a mine deep in the depths of
the earth. The prospector is searching for nuggets of gold
while avoiding the many creatures in the mine and navigating
the various machines found there.

Occupying every level of the mine are creatures called
snarfs, odd creatures consisting mostly of a big mouth. They
stake out a platform as their territory and patrol it
diligently. Fortunately, they cannot move up and down the
ladders or jump across the gaps between the platforms.

Found on some levels is a giant rat, affectionately
known as Ratty. Unlike the snarfs, he can climb up and down
the ladders. Luckily for the prospector, the gaps between
the platforms are too wide for Ratty to attempt to jump
across.

However, the creature with the odd stalk-like eyes,
known as Igor, cannot only climb up and down, he also can
jump between platforms.

Among the other creatures are the grofs, which lay their
eggs in mining carts and come leaping out when they hatch,
falling into the depths of the mine. Lastly, there are the
giant bats, which are relatively harmless, as long as the
prospector doesn"t bump into them or walk across an occupied
nest.

Contact with any of the creatures is fatal to the
prospector. Aside from the creatures, there are the various
machines within the mine, including elevators, teleportation
platforms, floating platforms, conveyor belts, and jets of
flame.

The prospector does have a few weapons to use against
these obstacles. His great jumping ability allows him to
leap over the creatures, across the gaps between platforms,
and onto elevators and other machinery. Scattered around
each level of the mine are gas bombs. When the prospector
touches one of these bombs, it goes off, normally knocking
out all the creatures on the current level. (Only Igor is
unaffected by the gas.) However, bumping into a stunned
creature is as fatal as bumping into an unstunned one.

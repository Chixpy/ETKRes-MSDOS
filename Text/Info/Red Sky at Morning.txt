Like most other releases from underrated developer Simulations Canada (SimCan), Red Sky at Morning lives up to their normal complex gameplay and high realism.The game is a simulation of a hypothetical world-wide naval war, including a potential nuclear release. You can, naturally, play as either the US or the USSR, each with an accurate array of ships and nuclear weapons at your disposal. One of the first SimCan game with graphics, it was awkward in execution (graphics are presented in separate screens instead of with other text... perhaps a result of them being added later after the whole game was already coded in ASCII), but is still impressive for its tremendous amount of research and many realistic factors. 
Overall, the game is a worthwhile challenge for naval simulation fans who are interested in Cold War portrayal, although it could have been made much more interesting with more diplomatic options a la Balance of Power. Two thumbs up! 

Note: Although the game is no longer in wide distribution, publisher SimCan still exists and is selling the game to anyone who contacts them directly. Register for ConSimWorld below and contact SimCan via "Community Support" folder.

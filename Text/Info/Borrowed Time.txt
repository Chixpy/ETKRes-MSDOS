One of the earliest and still the best murder mysteries ever made, Borrowed Time is a gripping story set in 1939.You play Sam Barlow, Private Eye, who must save his life from a death threat while investigating a case that has many twists and turns. Good writing, interface, and on-screen tutorial feature round off this forgotten classic in which you can die in many creative ways. The puzzles are not hard, but the fact that you"ll be shot dead for no apparent reason whatsover (until you restore numerous times to find out) really bog down what is otherwise a good gumshoe game.

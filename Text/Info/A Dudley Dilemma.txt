This rather lighthearted text adventure game features you as a Harvard University student living in Dudley House. Your goal is not very evident through most of the game, but, like all text adventures, you must solve a series of puzzles and navigate your way through mazes using nothing but your intellect and objects you find along the way. Befitting the games academic setting, there is a scene in here taken from a T. S. Eliot novel.

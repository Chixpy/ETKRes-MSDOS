Norumbega was a peaceful land. But all is not well in Norumbega as, Fang Duck, the evil ruler of the Dark Quarter region decided to invade the rest of Norumbega. Fang Duck in his haste to fill the land with his duck minions overlooked the coastal home of Peach, our titular hero. Being the spryest land lobster in all of Norumbega, Peach, has been chosen by the leaders of the coastal town to take out Fang Duck and restore peace to the lands. Luckily for you Fang Duck expected no resistance!

Peach The Lobster is an arcade platformer where you play the role of Peach. Peach the Lobster can jump around, and use his claw gun to hit enemies or monitors to release items like 1-up Lobsters, health-up shells and bonus points. Peach can also slide, run and duck under platforms and crevices. If your goal is a little higher than that well Peach can also double jump up there.

There are four regions that Peach will have to traverse. Grasslands is where the adventure begins. Filled with lush foliage, waterfalls and hills, Grasslands is the main territory in Norumbega. When you arrive in the region of Atland be wary of currents and underwater hazards as this region mysteriously sank under water a thousand years ago. The Norumbegan Caves is where you will find yourself after that. These torch-lit caverns lead up to windswept mountaintops and are the last stop before The Techno-Castle. This wannabe-technologic wonder fort is the Fang Duck"s lair and home to his bevy of futuristic minions including laser turrets, and robotic duck henchmen. Of course this all leads up to a final confrontation with the boss duck himself, Fang Duck.

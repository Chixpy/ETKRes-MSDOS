Original in concept but a bit flawed in execution, Guardians of Infinity sports one of the most original and elaborate plots ever presented in IF: you must journey back in time to save president Kennedy from being assassinated to prevent a disastrous spacetime rift in the future.

The interface allows you to give commands to each agent, who can be assigned to convince someone, rob the bank, or carry out other spy activities. The interface is a bit cumbersome and confusing, since you have to address each agent by their name first, and there"s no telling who you are talking to, not to mention the fact that sometimes their responses hardly make sense. There is also a very unforgiving time limit, which makes it frequent saving a necessity. Recommended only to IF lovers with a lot of patience and time on their hands. You definitely need the manual to play this game, as it contains locations and schedules of different people you will need to convince to prevent JFK"s fateful trip. Two thumbs up!

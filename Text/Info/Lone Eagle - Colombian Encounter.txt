A point and click adventure in the style of the old Sierra games.You begin your adventure when you learn that your friend has been killed by South American pirates. You travel to the area to investigate and then find yourself in trouble with the area pirates.

The seafaring setting is more than a gimmick - sailing, fishing and diving are incorporated into the game as puzzle scene, and the nautical elements are more integrated than in the Monkey Island games.

You control your character (man or woman, you choose) by clicking on a set of icons. These include movement and close examination of objects. There is much to explore, both at sea and on land.

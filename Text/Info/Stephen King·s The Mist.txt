This adventure is adapted from the 150-page novella "The Mist" by Stephen King.

While you are on a routine visit to the supermarket, a sinister, thick mist rolls into town, swallowing up everything in its path and trapping you. Can you escape amidst the ensuing panic, and make it out of this poisoned and bug-ridden town?

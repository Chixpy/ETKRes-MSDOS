Super Gem"Z is a fun puzzle game by Kaiko, a short-lived German developer who released several games for the Amiga before disbanding the company in 1993.A mixture between Gem"X, Kaiko"s previous game, and Bomberman, your goal in Super Gem"Z. Dozens of levels, power-ups, and colorful anime makes this a highly underrated classic. If you like the original Gem"X (on the Amiga only) or Bomberman, you will find Super Gem"Z a fun diversion. An interesting historical anecdote: this DOS version was never officially released, although it was ported in-house by Christoph Winkler (now a manager at VME) and a few friends. Later on, VME used the idea in a Playstation game called Inspector Gadget: Maze Panic. Big thanks for T.R., webmaster of the Kaiko fansite, for sending us this very rare, unreleased puzzler. Two thumbs up, way up!

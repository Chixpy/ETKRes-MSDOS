Chances are good that you are a part of the reason for the explosive growth in the popularity of video poker in the casinos of Nevada, Atlantic City and elsewhere.  For those who tire of just watching the spinning wheels of a slot machine, here is a game that they can play.  And for people used to the action of blackjack and other table games, here is a game that will challenge their skills to the limit, while offering lower wagers and a non-intimidating opponent.

Video poker can be one of the best bets in the house.  Many casinos offer machines with payouts that potentially exceed 100%. They would never make money doing this with slot machines, because slot machines require no skill to achieve the maximum payback.  Everyone "plays" the same way.  But even these high-payback video poker machines make plenty of money for the casinos, because most people don"t know how to play properly.

Every incorrect "hunch" that players bet on reduces the payback they can expect, until the average player would probably be better off back at their slot machine.

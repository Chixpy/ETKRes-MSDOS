Like VariTale before it, TEA is a BBS door for automating the infrastructure permitting the playing of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type plot-forking games -- all it needs are the stories, provided by your BBS userbase (or, optionally, by an included sample pack of 65 rooms)!  It starts you off with one room (not coincidentally an ad for the program"s home BBS) and from there users can write descriptions of new rooms (hypothetically an unlimited amount, but only 100 in the unregistered version) with plenty of options (not necessarily merely binary choices) and full hypertext capability to connect to any other written page regardless of whether it fits the chronology or sequence.

The game of euchre for slurps is an adaptation of the card game euchre. It is modeled after the way my friends and I used to play. And when you come to my house to play you had better learn the house rules. We have extracted the essence of the word euchre and applied it to the game it portrays. The dictionary defines the word EUCHRE meaning to cheat or to deceive, and that"s exactly how this game is played. Not to worry for the computer has no advantage in this cheating arena. I have added a few twists to the program in an effort to make it more interesting. The first area is in choosing a partner and your opponents (as in life) they play at different skill levels. A player with an experience rating less than 4 is easily deceived and will play poor euchre. In the range of 5 to 7 the play improves and are not so easily duped. Above this the play is difficult. I designed the program and know the 5 W"s and the computer is still able to deceive me. So type in euchre and see what mean.

Bricks is a clone of the game Breakout. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to destroy a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball. Each brick the ball comes into contact with will be destroyed, but if the ball falls off the bottom of the screen you lose a life. At some point in each level a bonus brick will appear (as indicated by the black border); if you can hit this brick before it turns back into a normal brick you will earn numerous bonus points. There are three different skill levels available.

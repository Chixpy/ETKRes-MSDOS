Veteran wargamer M. Evan Brooks said it all in his synopsis of the game: "The 500th Anniversary of Columbus was PIC (politically incorrect).The movies, televisions, books quickly became major "busts". This game was no different -- slow, dull, user unfriendly. If this showed Columbus in a positive light, it is a wonder he ever secured the wherewithal to head an expedition." 

Enough (dis)recommendation, methinks [EG]. Too bad the engine used in Merchant Colony was only marginally improved for this utterly boring game. Go play Sid Meier"s Colonization for Windows instead if you"re a fan of the period.

P-ROBOTS ("pee-robots") is a game based on computer programming in PASCAL.  The concept and framework was inspired by C-ROBOTS (the same concept, except using the C language).

The object of the game is to design and program a "robot" that can triumphover similar robots designed and programmed by others in a real-time battleof wits and flying missiles.  You control your robot by writing a procedurein PASCAL to specify your robot"s behavior and strategy in its efforts tovanquish up to three other robots in a battle to the death.  A variety ofpre-defined P-ROBOTS PASCAL functions and procedures allow your robot totrack its position on the battlefield, monitor its health or damagecondition, and calculate the distance and angle to opponents from itscurrent battlefield position.  Each robot is equipped with a cannon to firemissiles, and a motorized drive mechanism to either close in for the killof a hapless opponent or flee from a fierce foe. Optionally, robots may beequipped with bombs, a repair kit, different types of armor and warheads, adeflection shield, and/or a cloaking device.

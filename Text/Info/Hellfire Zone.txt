As a pilot of an Apache Helicopter you have to fly through enemy terrain and save captured F-14 pilots. A wide range of enemies like tanks, soldiers, and air units such as airfighters and heavy-armed choppers will try to stop you.

Armed with chainguns and missiles, destroy enemy strongholds to rescue your comrades. Extra weapons can be picked up by landing close to objects.

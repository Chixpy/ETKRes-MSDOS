Race in the little leagues, except these Karts are anything but slow! With the fastest going up to 130 MPH, these karts are what professional race drivers drive to keep their edge in the off-season! 

Choose from three classes of engines, 4 types of chasis, and 4 types of tires. Customize your kart and your alter ego to specific colors, stripes, and logos, even racing numbers. Adjust your gear ratio for optimum acceleration vs. top speed. 

Join single-race at any of the dozen different tracks, each with their own challenges, or play a full season"s championship against ruthless AI who will shove you out of the way if they can. 

When you"re finished having fun, invite your friends to compete on the network!

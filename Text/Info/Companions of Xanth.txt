This game is an adaptation of Piers Anthony"s fantasy novel Demons Don"t Dream (included in some releases), taking place in his mystical and punny world of Xanth.  Unlike Legend"s previous parser-based adventures, this one is fully mouse-controlled. Commands such as "take", "give to" and "listen" are on the left of the screen, directional icons and an inventory are at the bottom, with an illustration of the current location taking up over half of the screen.

Two otherworldly and all-powerful demons are are competing with two unwitting human champions over the future of the land - if Dug wins, the magic Xanth will disappear forever. The player controls Dug, who is also fighting his friend Kim to avoid losing his girlfriend. To get through the game"s puzzles and mazes, the player must also choose a Companion character and interact with them. Cutscenes drive the story along.

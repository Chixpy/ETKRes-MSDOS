Welcome to Galactic Conquest. If you"ve ever wanted to be what every super-villain worth his salt has wanted for millenia, then you"ve hit the right button. This program gives you the chance to conquer the entire galaxy, without leaving your chair. It is up to you to out-smart the opponent, whether computer or human. Send forth immense armadas to squash the enemy like the bugs they are, or do nothing and hope to God that mother nature hates them worse then she hates you (Face it, weathermen normally couldn"t predict a 100% chance of photon-storms...). You start out with one planet, some production (# ships made per each year), and a one-year head-start against the computer.

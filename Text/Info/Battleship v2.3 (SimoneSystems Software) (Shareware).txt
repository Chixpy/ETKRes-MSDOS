Thank you for trying SimoneSystems "BATTLESHIP" version 2.3, the classic game of Battleship, with a twist.  BATTLESHIP provides an easy to use mouse interface, and VGA high resolution graphics.  The twist?  BATTLESHIP adds another level of strategy to the game with these special game features:

Mines! With mines, you can get a head start on your opponent by exposing part of his navy without firing a shot. You can also help guard your ships from enemy attack.

Islands! The virtually unlimited combination of screen layouts make each game different!

Submerge Submarine! Just when the enemy starts aiming at your sub, give the order to dive!  Submerge your submarine to a depth even the computer can"t hit!

Move Spy Ship! Secretly move your spy ship to a new location after the game has already started!  But watch out for those enemy mines!

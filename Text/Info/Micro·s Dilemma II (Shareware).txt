The object of this game is to remove all spheres from the play field. You control Micro. You must have Micro strategically move mirrors around the play field so that the beam (fired from an immovable laser) comes in contact with all the spheres. Of course, there are various objects on the play field which may inhibit your ablitity to do this easily. Also, the beam can only destroy purple spheres. On levels where there are both purple and green spheres, you must find a small switch box which will change all the spheres to purple. If you successfully eliminate all the spheres, you move on to the next level.

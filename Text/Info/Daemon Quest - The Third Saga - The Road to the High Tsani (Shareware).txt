Introduction:

This is  the third  installment in  the on-going Daemon Quest series.  And, if I may says so, this may prove to  be the  best of the  three.    This  file  contains  a  quick file to help you get started and tell you a little bit about the game.  I have tried to put the  most important  stuff first  and leave the less important (but not necessarily less interesting stuff) last.

About the game:

All the Daemon Quest games are designed so  that they  may be played independently of one another although they were designed as a series.  This is the third game in the series but  that does not mean that you have to have played the first in order to enjoy this one.  Also, playing this game first will not give  away many vital clues to  the first  two.  In other words, order is nice, it helps keep the plot straight, but it isn"t essential.

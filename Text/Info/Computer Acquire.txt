Computer Acquire is a faithful translation of AH"s famous boardgame of the same name.In this game of oligopoly, up to 6 players, any of which can be computer-controlled, compete to build a hotel chain through acquisition. A more detailed description from the great Sid Sackson fansite: "The game is played on a 12 X 9 grid, with squares going from A-1 through I-12. Each player has a hand of six tiles drawn at random, and each turn starts with the placing of a tile into its corresponding square on the board. These tiles represent hotels, though the theme is arbitrary. As soon as two hotels are placed adjacent to one another, they form a chain. The player who initially creates the chain gets one share (out of a total of 25 available) of stock in the new hotel chain. After placing a tile, each player is entitled to purchase up to three shares of stock in any chain currently on the board. As additional tiles are placed adjacent to a chain, increasing it in size, the value of that stock increases." 

If you love business sims, you will enjoy this excellent ASCII classic that is very faithful to the board game, with a tremendous replay value and good AI.

Blast Zone is, as it is described by its own authors, a "typical shoot"em up game with powerups, hordes of really disgusting aliens and bosses". Although not very technically impressive, this game is still fun to play due to its tight control and short stages which really keep things moving. Bland graphics detract from the enjoyment a bit but this game still would be a shooter of the Space Invaders style variety if played in short bursts.

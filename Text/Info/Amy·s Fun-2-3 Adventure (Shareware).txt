"So much FUN has been put into this incredible educational program, that you won"t be able to keep your kids away from it! An adorable little puppy named Amy guides young children through four entertaining activities which help teach number recognition and counting skills. Outstanding animated graphics and real speech and sound effects add to the counting fun.

In addition to Amy, there"s Marty the Match Machine, King Cookie, Danny Dragon and an interactive xylophone on which kids can learn to play 8 different children"s songs - or make up their own!"

WormWorld for Windows is a puzzle/arcade game for windows featuring a worm which moves like a slinky toy. The object of the game is to get the worm into the exit pot. However, there are many hazards and traps in the way, such as spikes and falling blocks. You can drop command blocks in front of the worm. When the worm eats the blocks, it will perform the command, such as stop and turn around, make a slime bridge, and even walk on the roof! This game also features a complete point-and-click level editor to allow you to make additional levels.

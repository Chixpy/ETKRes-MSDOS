A piece of hyperfiction masquerading as a rare romantic text adventure game about a big date with what could be Mr. Right.  Choose-your-own-adventure interaction spins the customized player along whimsical tangents but ultimately all plot forks either lead to dead ends or rejoin the fixed-rail central narrative. Manic and wacky energy drive even the second chances resulting from the selection of obviously wrong choices, all while skewering conventions of the romance genre.

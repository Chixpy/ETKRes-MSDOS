Nirvana is an interactive text adventure taking place in the World of Wimsey. The game, which is familiar with over one thousand words, is played by entering simple two or three word phrases to direct the actions your character performs. You may use simplified letters to direct movement such as U for up or W for West. Speaking with the multitude of characters on your adventures is performed by simply placing what you want to say in "quotation marks".

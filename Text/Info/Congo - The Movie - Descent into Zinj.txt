Congo is an adventure game adapted from the 1995 movie of the same name. The plot revolves around a search for a diamond that presumably have power enough to change the world of telecommunications as we know it. On a mission issued by Travis, the head of TraviCom, you are sent in contemporary Congo in order to recover the diamond and find out what has happened to another expedition led by Dr. Karen Ross.  

As you arrive at the place of you destination more and more pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together in a wholesome picture as even more  questions arise. Who are the monster gorillas populating the area? What is the meaning of all the Egyptian writings found throughout the place? What drives Amy -- a sentient gorilla capable of speech, to help you? And most importantly -- how to survive and get hold of the precious diamond and, perhaps, save the unfortunate souls of the first expedition in the process.

The gameplay is that of a classical inventory-based adventure. Although occasionally the game does depart from the formula. It mostly concerns the sequences where player should operate a multi-functional device resembling a laptop. With it"s use player is able to analyze visual images to gain clues, record audio, track homing signals on the map and examine additional info from the  files downloaded from the TraviCom network. Other notable gameplay features include navigating a river by boat and a maze-like sequence in the middle of the game. Visually the game is similar to the first-person adventure games of it"s era tracing its roots to Myst.

NOTA: Usa Windows 3.11

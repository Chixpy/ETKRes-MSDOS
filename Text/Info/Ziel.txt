A nice action adventure game set in a fantasy-like world. Ziel plays like other Zelda style games; the battles are real time and the gameplay is based on adventure elements. This demo only contains a small quest, but it can pass for a mini-game. Nice graphics, especially the game characters. Minimal Sound Blaster sound effects are featured and they are annoying.

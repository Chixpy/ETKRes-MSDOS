A classic western story, but in Disney"s cartoons style. Mr. Vyle, an evil squire, controls a border country town, beautiful girls, in this case Melissa, included. But Tequila (Terence Hill alias a lynx) and Boom Boom (Bud Spencer alias a brown bear) arrive to stop him and his plans, and save the maiden. 

Classic point&click adventure, with simple interface. Besides puzzles, there are some arcade mini-games (like shoot at a money in the air) too.

Xi You Ji is a Chinese-made side-scrolling beat-em-up game by the authors of Sango Fighter. The player chooses to control one of the characters out of a group of predominantly animal fighters who are going for a pilgrimage to India, as described in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, on which the game is based. The heroes encounter numerous enemies along the way, of which they dispose with their unique fighting skills. The gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the arcade game Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

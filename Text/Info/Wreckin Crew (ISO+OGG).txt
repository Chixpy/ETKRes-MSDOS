Wrecking Crew is a racing game similar to Mario Kart. Players take control of unorthodox characters such as a pair of Siamese twins, a circus trainer and a mad scientist, and race their hot-rods across ten tracks using unusual weapons such as lighting bolts, body bags and chickens.

A two-player mode is available, and there are many funny unlockable characters. The tracks are sprawling, with teleports, secret routes and hidden areas to find.

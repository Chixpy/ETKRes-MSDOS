One of the rarer TV game show conversions, Super Password is a decent PC version of the Pearson game show, although it"s not very exciting since the game show itself isn"t very interesting to begin with.
Super Password depicts the last round of the same name in the game show Password. In this trivia quiz variant, celebrities are given ten passwords starting with a certain letter (for example, "A") and continue alphabetically through to another letter (in this case, "J"). Each letter is the starting letter of the password that the contestant must identify. The contestant had 60 seconds (one minute) to guess each password. Contestants are given $100 for each word they get right. If the contestant correctly guesses the password, he/she will get a chance to solve the puzzle for which the password serves as a clue. The puzzle"s solution can be either a PERSON, PLACE, or a THING. Puzzles are similar to Wheel of Fortune, but are much more straightforward. This computer version sports lackluster graphics, boring questions, and very little replay value due to the the repetitive nature of the puzzles. Overall, try this one only if you"re a die-hard fan of the original show.

"VGA Lunar Lander is a two player game originally created on an Atari ST. Converting the game over to IBM was not an easy task. Good sprite animation is hard to do without custom-made assembly language routines, however this entire game was created with Borland"s Turbo C++. The graphics are exactly the same as in the Atari ST version, only the resolution is much greater! VGA"s "medium" mode (640X350X16) looks great compared to the 320 by 200 mode on the ST.

For now, the game can be played by two players only, unless you just let the other ship die constantly. A one player mode will be available later if I receive enough registered users. This game can be very addicting and fun between two players. Under no circumstances shall I be responsible for pains in the stomach from too much laughter or fights resulting from kamikaze attempts."

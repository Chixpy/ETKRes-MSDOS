Guide Dave through ten terrifying levels as he tries to reclaim his trophies from a deserted pirate"s hideout! This is a standard platform run and jump game although with only 10 levels it"s meant to be more difficult than the usual.

This game is in 16-color double-res mode on the Apple II and is essentially the same as the original Apple II hi-res version titled "Dangerous Dave in the Deserted Pirate"s Hideout".

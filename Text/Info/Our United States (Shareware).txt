Our United States is a fun and easy game to play. There are 100 questions with four possible answers, but only one of them is correct. If your answer is correct, you are awarded 50 points PLUS 5 points for each bonus block remaining. The quicker you answer, the higher your bonus will be. If your answer is incorrect, the score remains unchanged, but you lose 1 turn. An extra turn will be given each time you answer 10 questions correctly. When you run out of turns, or successfully advance to question 100, the game ends.

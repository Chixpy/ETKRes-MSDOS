King Tenlox the Long-Winded of Cwilia was turned into a pink blancmange at a party by the Lord High Wizard of Theodolia, Grizzell. As he had been nearly eaten, he was justifiably annoyed. So he told the L.H.W. of Cwilia, Spellchick, to zap Grizzell. Spellchick agreed. However, Grizzell decided to be hung for a sheep as a lamb and kidnapped Princess Caddelli, Tenlox"s daughter and good friend of Spellchick"s, for good measure. He protected her with a formidable array of foes: there were the brooms and wands which would gore people, the three radioactive rattlesnakes (who were called Snake, Rattle and Roland), the Fidgety Bridge which never keeps still, and of course the Star Cat (of Directory Enquiries, perhaps. *. to his friends) who has a long catalogue of crimes! (In-joke... Ask a Beeb owner.) Spellchick has to fight his way through SIX screens of this kind of thing for every one of the TWELVE castles owned by Grizzell, in order to rescue Caddelli. Phew. It"s not easy, let me tell you! (You start at Castle Diamond.)

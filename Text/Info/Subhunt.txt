Subhunt is a single-player shareware submarine game developed at the Laboratory for Recreational Computing at the University of North Texas. The game places the player in control of a Shark-class mini-submarine. The story behind the game has the player as a new recruit to the top secret Special Operations Division.

Working for this organisation and in charge of a refitted Shark-class mini-sub the player will wrestle control of tourist shipping lanes from the terrorist group Nemesis, stop illegal whalers and long-line trawlers decimating marine species, and discover what is decimating commercial shipping.

The full game consists of 12 missions, only one of which was included in the shareware release. Each mission has three levels of difficulty.

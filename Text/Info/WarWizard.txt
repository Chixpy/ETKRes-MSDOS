Essentially, the objective of WarWizard  is to search the world in order to find clues as to the locations of the Artifacts your predecessor used to defeat the first High King of Terwan.  Upon retrieving all nine artifacts, you are to locate the Evil WarWizard in Aladain and defeat him in battle.

During the quest you may acquire treasure, magical items, and up to three other companions to aid you on your quest.  Note that these companions may and should vary and that you most likely will not keep the same ones throughout the game.  The characters and their classes will vary as the game proceeds, and it is up to the player to determine how he will utilize their various and unique talents on different parts of his quest.

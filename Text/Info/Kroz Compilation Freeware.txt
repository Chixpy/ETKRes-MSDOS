Kroz holds a special place in the history of Apogee.  It"s the original game in the company history.  It"s recognized as "The first Apogee game", and it was released in late 1987.  There actually were a few games put out before that using the name Apogee, but that was just Scott Miller solo projects, and not as "Apogee" (the company).  An awful lot of people owe their livelyhood to this 22 year old silly (by today"s standards) ASCII game.  

Anyway, this game was deleted from Apogee"s product line a very long time ago.  Over the years, we"ve had many requests to release the game as freeware, and we"re finally doing that in March of 2009.  Kroz has a rather twisted naming history.  While it"s recongized there were "Seven" episodes of Kroz, there were more than seven games.  Below is is Scott Miller"s intended "play order" of the Kroz games.  As you can see, the "play order" is not the same as "release date order".

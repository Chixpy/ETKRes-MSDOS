Manic Karts is the follow-up to Manic Media"s hit game SuperKarts. Different from all-new tracks, improved graphics & sound and familiar gameplay of SuperKarts, probably the biggest offer Manic Karts has is the SVGA resolution along the choice of four classes of kart (you can race in 50cc up to 250).

All you have to do in this karting sim is to overtake your competitors using your power-ups and skill and as always make sure that they are behind you...

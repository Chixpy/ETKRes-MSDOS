Leo the Lion is a below average platformer from Poland starring - well, Leo the lion.Think of the game as Disney"s Lion King, minus good cartoons and interesting gameplay. So what is left? A hodgepodge of amateurish graphics, boring levels, and repetitive gameplay. If you enjoy cartoon platformers, Leo the Lion should be at the very bottom of your list. There are simply far too many better games around, including Disney"s long line of platformers and Monolith"s highly underrated Claw. One to avoid, unless you want to collect every game ever made. In my humble opinion, Leo the Lion is not a Real Dog - but it comes quite close to that (dis)honor.

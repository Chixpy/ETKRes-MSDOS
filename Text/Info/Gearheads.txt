In turn-based mode you have to activate different mechanical toys to get from one part of the sand-box to another. Your opponent do the same. If your toys pass their way twenty one times then you are winner. There are 12 types of toys. Every toy has own program of behaviour and out of control after activation. Some of toys has a program to deactivate the enemy toy.

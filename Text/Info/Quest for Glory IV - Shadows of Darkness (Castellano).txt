Sierra"s fourth Quest For Glory game is a journey into the land of Mordavia, a Transylvania-like setting. Our Hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our Hero. He"ll discover his quest soon enough; that is, if he lives!

Like the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and RPG. You can play as a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Once again you improve your skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve your throwing ability, which you might need to solve a puzzle). The combat system in this fourth installment is different: viewed from a platform perspective, it allows you to move freely, attack, defend, and even jump in real time, like in fighting games.

A wonderful game that followed on the heels of Disney"s earlier Mickey"s ABC: A Day at The Fair, Mickey"s 123: The Big Surprise Party teaches the basic concept of numbers to nine to toddlers ages 0 - 3 in a fun, engaging way. The goal is to help Mickey organize a surprise birthday party for one of his friends. He has to go to a toy store to buy a present, buy food at the supermarket, and choose who to invite. Each of these activities are full of opportunities for number lessons. On the way to each location, for instance, kids can press any number key to give Mickey a ride-- via a vehicle with that many wheels on it (e.g. pressing "3" will give him a tricycle, with 3 wheels). Inside the supermarket, pressing a number key will make Mickey buy that many items (hamburgers, fries, etc.). Whenever a number key is pressed, Mickey will start counting from one to that number, with big flashcards and clear pronunciation. 

The game is not long, but kids will have too much fun organizing the party and seeing funny antics of various Disney characters (Goofy, Donald Duck, and many more) to realize that they are learning. By the time the party is over, kids will likely be able to count from one to nine, and recognize what each number looks like. If they need more practice, they can always organize another party for another friend in the Disney town. With great VGA graphics, smooth animations, excellent digitized voices, and user-friendly gameplay, Mickey"s 123 is a great game for toddlers who are just learning to talk. Highly recommended!

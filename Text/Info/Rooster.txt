Rooster is a 2D top-down shooter with logic elements visually resembles the game Alien Breed. The player"s task is to annihilate terrorists from Mars who have mastered the science base on the moon, where the best Earth scientists conducted research on new types of weapons.

Another exotic - Poland (in Polish) shooter with a view from the top, which is, apparently, a variation on the unforgettable Alien Breed . Unfortunately, the language barrier does not allow to fully understand the plot of this game, but for games, he was never particularly important. And so it is clear in fact, that the action takes place in a dystopian future, and we have to fight with some hostile forces. Gameplay is really the most that on is a classic 2d-shooter: we manage the most likely person (or perhaps a robot) , running on some maze of corridors and destroy enemies (without a doubt robots), collecting bonuses to make up for the health and ammo. Within a short time after the beginning of play becomes quite difficult. Graphically the game looks very nice, especially pleases clarity drawing the main character (despite the complete 2D). However, at first it may seem a little odd that in the range of games dominated turquoise, but then you get used to. And because the language of the game really does not matter, Rooster can be warmly recommended to all lovers of style games Alien Breed , especially given its dynamic and well known.

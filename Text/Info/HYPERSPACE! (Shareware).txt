HYPERSPACE! is a strategic simulation of those bygone days of yesteryear when the various empires of the (then) known galaxy were constantly at war. Hyperdrive technology was invented by the Terran Federation and first put to practical use in Star Year 2435. Although this new technology was capable of moving even the largest vessels from one end of the galaxy to the other in the blink of an eye, it did exhibit one major flaw. The reconstruction of molecules at the point of destination required the use of a blueprint of the original ship and did not allow for variables (excluding carbon-based life forms). This meant that while a ship could be instantly transported to any point in the galaxy with its crew intact, it could not carry cargo.

Walk around and examine your environment, gather materials you need to solve puzzles--and gather weapons to defend yourself against the minions of evil. The hero can walk, sneak (in order to avoid fighting monsters) or run. He fights in real time, striking with melee, and later also long-ranged weapons, and parrying the opponents" hits when necessarily.

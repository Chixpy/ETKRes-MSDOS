Lychnis is one of the true hidden gems of gaming -- produced by the Korean company Softmax, in cooperation with the indie development team Artcraft. The developers of this game would go on to create some of the most famous Korean games, including Ragnarok Online, Granado Espada and the Magna Carta series. The music is done by Sound Team TeMP, whose work you may have heard in the PangYa / Super Swing Golf games, as well as in the aforementioned titles.

Lychnis was their first game, and it"s one hell of a debut. While it wasn"t anything near state-of-the-art with its simple graphics, tiny sprites and occasional slowdowns, it excelled in two areas the IBM-PC wasn"t exactly famous for: ultra-smooth scrolling and spot-on controls.

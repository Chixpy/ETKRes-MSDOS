"The object of this game is to catch all of the bugs in less than a quarter of the screen. To do this you need to draw a wall to contain the bugs.

> You draw your wall with the arrow keys.
> Enter turns on and off the wall.
> If the wall is off, you can erase walls (except bug walls)
> Pressing the F key attracts the bugs with food.
(press f again to turn it off)
> Pressing the K key will set off a bug spray. Some bugs are killed,
some go crazy. A crazy bug is never killed. You get 15 sprays.
> Slow things down with the space bar.
> Sometimes a Bug will multiply.
> Escape key to Play a new game, or to exit.
> Sometimes a Bug will multiply.
> Sometimes the bugs build their own ""X"" walls. You cannot
go through these, but a borer can.
> Sometimes a Bug will Bore away your wall.
(Turn this off and on with the Tab key)

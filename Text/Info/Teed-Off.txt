Teed-Off is a simple golf game. The object, not surprisingly, is to get your ball into the hole. Much like many modern golf games, you choose your club, angle, then hit the spacebar to time your shot. Although the graphics are quite poor compared to modern golf games (CGA 4-color graphics here, mostly circles and boxes) it does show that the basic game mechanics didn"t evolve much over the next few years, besides improvements in the presentation of the games.

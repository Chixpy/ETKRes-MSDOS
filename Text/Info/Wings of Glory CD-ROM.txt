The year is 1916, the dawn of the first World War. New pilots are being trained in use of the airplane, a still relatively new flying invention that may yet have some military value. Certainly the German army is using them, and therefore it"s up to the British to respond. Stationed in a small airfield in the town of Thetford, England, a small group of pilots have been transfered from the allied countries to form a squadron and fight against German forces

Wings of Glory is one of the relatively few World War 1 flight simulators. It is played in 1st person, with 3rd person camera options and uses Origin"s RealSpace Engine. In the main campaign, players start as a fresh rookie pilot, newly transfered to England. Players can have conversations with other pilots,check the kill board for the entire squadron or commence the next mission. Missions begin with a briefing explaining the objectives and then players are put in the front seat of their aircraft. They must take off, reach the appropriate waypoints, perform the objective and return home to land. All planes have a machine gun, of varying capacities , which fires in front of the plane. Some planes are also able to carry bombs. There is no radar or other detection method on the planes, so players must be alert to oncoming enemies.

In addition to the usual campaign mode it also featured a "Gauntlet mode" where the player faces a never-ending wave of successive waves of enemy aircraft. The goal of Gauntlet mode is simply to last as long as possible. The game also features a mission designer to create custom scenarios.

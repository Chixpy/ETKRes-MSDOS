"Nibbles was the story of a contest between Sammy the Snake and Jake the Cobra. The contest consisted of determining who could eat more numbers without crashing into a wall. Jake was brutally defeated, and was left humiliated while Sammy gained world recognition. Nibbles 2 is the story of Jake"s Revenge.

Sammy was lying at home, eating supper, when Jake paid him a visit. Sammy had grown quite fat after winning the tournament, assuming that what he won in the tournament would leave him set for. Because of this, Jake easily subdued him and brought him over to an island fortress. There, Sammy was thrown into a glutton"s nightmare: a huge labyrinth with a limited food supply.

Sammy must eat at least nine boxes of Snake Chow every sixty seconds, or he will faint from hunger. To make matters worse, Jake has set up his labyrinth in such a way that Sammy will lose sight of his food as he nears the exit. Fortunately, Sammy has developed a radar sense to help him locate his chow boxes.

Sammy requires all of his wits to escape, and the rest is up to you!"

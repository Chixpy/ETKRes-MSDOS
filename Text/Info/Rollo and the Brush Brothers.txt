Rollo And The Brush Bros was originally created by Windmill software in 1984 and released as a copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC/XT. It is similar to the arcade game Amidar.

In this arcade game you play the role of "Rollo", where the aim of the game is to paint the entire section while evading the "Brush Brothers" in order to progress in the game.

The sequel to F-19 Stealth Fighter - take America"s premiere stealth fighter out for a spin in several battle areas, including the Persian Gulf, Cuba, and even Vietnam.  There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in "cold war" and full-scale war situations.  Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals.

The game actually has two flight modes. In the "authentic" mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the "theoretical" mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.

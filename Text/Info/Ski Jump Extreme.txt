Ski Jump Extreme is a ski jumping simulation. This game has a lot diffrent rules than in real ski jumping championship. There are two players. You and your opponent jump through fifteen hills, twice on each hill. After these we"ve got a winner. Leader has a yellow shirt. You must jump as near the end of the hill as possible (nearer gives longer jump). If you jump too early you will be disqualified. Points, which are given, depends only on a jump width (no referees - no problem). So... play the game and have much fun.

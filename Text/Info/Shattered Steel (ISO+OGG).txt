Shattered Steel is a first-person 3D action game similar in concept to MechWarrior series. The player takes control of bipedal machines (mechs) known as Planet Runners, trying to protect humanity against alien menace. The single player campaign takes place on five different planets, with about twenty missions available for each. The missions mostly involve direct assaults, infiltration of enemy strongholds, defending own bases, or escorting important figures.

The player can pilot up to seven different Runners in different sizes and shapes, having their own strengths and weaknesses. Each Runner is equipped with primary and secondary weapons which are either energy-charged or require bullets. The enemies are mostly shaped like animals and can be taken out using the game"s locational damage system: for example, it is possible to incapacitate (but not kill) enemies by destroying their legs. The game also features deformable terrain, which may be used to the player"s advantage in a few cases. A mission editor, an "anarchy" mode with co-op options, and a multiplayer mode for up to sixteen players are included as well.

Racer is a simple car racing game with randomly generated tracks. In practice the name is a bit misleading, because although you drive a car the object is to collect items for points and avoid crashing, not to "race" against anyone else. The game plays like an inverted "falling down the well" sort of game, and although the graphics scroll smoothly there isn"t a lot of exciting stuff to be found here.

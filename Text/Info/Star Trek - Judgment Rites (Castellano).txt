Sequel to Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, Star Trek: Judgment Rites brings back the entire Enterprise crew in eight new episodes. Strange things are happening in distant space, such as dead planets spawning life and WW1 planes in outer space. You need to survive these situations.

You must navigate your way through space, and send away teams onto planets to investigate situations, communicate with other characters and solve puzzles. Unlike the previous game, action sequences are optional.

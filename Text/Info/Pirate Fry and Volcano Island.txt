Pirate Fry is an independent game made with the AGS Engine and is the first game in the Pirate Fry Trilogy.

The gameplay is in classic point-and-click fashion. The player has to select an action and then click on the object or the person to interact. There are four actions: "walk", "look", "talk" and "use/interact". Objects can be picked up in order to combine them or to use them later. They are stored in a inventory accessible at all times.

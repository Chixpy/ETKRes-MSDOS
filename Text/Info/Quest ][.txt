Quest ][ is a somewhat unusual game, replete with a kind of celebratory strangeness that only the young or confirmedly peculiar can muster up.  After selecting the player"s shoe size, a baffling story is set up pertaining to the rescue of the daughter of a historical would-be knight errant, Trepto -- and your player"s time-traveling mission to assist him in this task, under the pain of nuclear demolition.

Navigating some MS-DOS-era utility software-style graphical text-button menus, the player wanders a perplexing complex described as in a text adventure game and interacted with via [h]otkey multiple-choice options.  Some combat may or may not be conducted with downright deranged enemies ("a group of Severed human heads"?!), following which the player emerges overland and starts attempting to navigate a map of France in the 1700s via coordinates.  Then, upon finding a town, the player goes from building to building attempting to locate the knight and his daughter -- now courtesy of a roguelike interface!  It"s all a little overwhelming, though eventually the strangenesses add up with a kind of internal consistency.

Morty Maxwell, the Master of Mischief, has moved into the Shady Glen Technology Center and taken over as the head scientist! Your job is to accept Morty"s challenge and prove that you are a better scientist than he is. Morty has locked the doors in the warehouse with science puzzles. Show him how much you know about science by solving the puzzles. Then go through the doors, find the best vehicle parts, and build faster vehicles than Morty builds. To make your job more difficult, Morty"s sneaky Cyber Chimps are collecting vehicle parts, too. Outsmart the Chimps by throwing bananas to them and making them take a nap. Race against Morty and win all 15 of the challenge races. You will reclaim the Technology Center and be the head scientist!

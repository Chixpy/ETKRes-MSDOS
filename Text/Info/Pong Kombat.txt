Created during the golden age of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Pong Kombat is a freeware parody of the game combining it with the low-tech Pong. There"s even a storyline revolving around the ancient powerful white paddle (remember him?) and the multi-coloured younger paddles who would challenge him. There"s even talk of a mysterious Monolith, secret character of great power, hidden somewhere in the tournament.

Player 1:

                         +---+
         FIRE          | W |   UP
    +------------+   +---+
    | Left Shift  |    +---+
    +------------+    | X |   DOWN
                           +---+

     Now, fire alone does diddley.  However, fire in combination
with up and down can shoot projectiles, do fatalities, and other
fun things which are more or less secret.

     Player two, on the right, uses these keys.

                          +--------------+
         FIRE           | UPARROW  |    UP
    +------------+    +-------------+
    | RightShift |    +-----------------+  
    +------------+    | DOWNARROW |  DOWN
                           +-----------------+

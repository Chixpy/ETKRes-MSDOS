"Antares Bros. created an interesting business model with their games. You sent in a picture of yourself (or anyone) and they would digitize the face to be in the game. They would also change the name in the game to match the person. All for under $20.

(YOUR NAME HERE), The famous ""New Age Warrior"", has been dropped on the island of REPTALIA to investigate many strange disappearences at a top secret biological testing site. There you find a new race of semi-intelligent reptiles preparing for war against the human race under the guidance and domination of a powerful lizard king. You must battle your way through their barbarous lands to the palace of the lizard king and destroy him and thereby prevent the certain castrophe that will follow
if he is not stopped. GOOD LUCK!... You"ll need it!

(Jungles, caverns, palace of the Lizard King, and more levels are in the full version naturally.)"

Many years ago, during the times of the Myoung dynasty, a martial art known as Geuk Cho Ho Kwon prospered. Gradually, it became forgotten and was considered a mere legend by most people. But lately this mysterious technique resurfaced, as Asian countries began to grow weak, and Western powers strived to use the fighting art for their purpose. To decide the fate of Geuk Cho Ho Kwon, fighters from various countries came to compete in the ultimate championship and demonstrate their knowledge of the great art.

Geuk Cho Ho Kwon is a versus fighting game. The game allows two players to compete against each other and also offers a single-player mode with the computer AI taking control over the opponent. There are twelve fighters to choose from, each representing a different country (Korea, China, USA, etc.) and fighting in his or her own stylized location. Attacks include punches and kicks and combinations thereof, performed together with jumping or ducking. In addition, each character has a limited amount of powerful special attacks at his or her disposal.

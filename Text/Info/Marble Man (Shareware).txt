The object of the game is very simple. There are two players. You are the Blue man and the computer plays the Red man. At the start of each game, there will be Red balls placed on the grid at the top and an equal number of Blue balls matching this pattern on the bottom. The objective is for the players to push their balls to the other side of the grid. The blue player tries to push his balls up, and off the top, while the red player pushes his balls down to the bottom. Each ball contains the a value corresponding to its position on the grid. For the Blue balls, the nearer they are to the top of the screen, the higher the value. The same is true for the Red player, but in reverse.

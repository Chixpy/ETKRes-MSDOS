NeoHunter plays like a cinematic-backdrop shooter similar to Virtua Squad series. It mixes some puzzle solving and light elements of resource managing (like gathering credits to get new weapons and equipment), and also allows the player to choose the next steps to take, making for a quasi-linear experience.

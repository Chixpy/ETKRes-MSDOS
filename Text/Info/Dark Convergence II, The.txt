This is the sequel to The Dark Convergence and takes place some time after the end of the original game.

The player has survived the horrible night, but his mind is deeply scarred by the horrors he had to face. In fact, the player lives as a bum, wandering aimlessly on the streets, not capable of retrieving his own lost sanity. A new horrid menace may be lurking underneath the apparent calm and may be linked to the psychiatrist who is searching for the player...

This game uses the same engine as the original game with similar gameplay and atmospheres.

One of the few political sims available, take over the Kremlin as one of the three Russian leaders (Ligachov, Yeltsin, or Gorbachov), determine your foreign and domestic policies, and react to the crises that happens (like the Chernobyl crisis). Keep yourself in office by keeping both the Nationalists and the Reformists in line. Can you do better than Gorbachov himself?

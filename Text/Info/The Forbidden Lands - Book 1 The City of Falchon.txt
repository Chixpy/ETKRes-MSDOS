Thank you for playing the first game in the Forbidden Lands saga! We think that you will find the game both challenging and fun. The game has no pre-set goal, although the built-in quests for weapons and special items are goals in themselves. A player can grow and develop into an almost god-like character (within the context of the game, of course!), and since experience needed for each level increases every time, there will always be a goal to shoot for. We have been as faithful as possible to the original multi-user version of Book I. The game has been entirely recoded for stand-alone, single player use and nothing has been removed. This is not cripple-ware! The game is here in its entire form...the only things not functioning are the Guilds and the Jail (neither of which is essential for gameplay). All else including keys, weapons quests, etc. are intact. We hope you enjoy it!

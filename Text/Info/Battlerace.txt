Most conventional futuristic race - a great game, but just to go through, not to describe. A choice of four planets, the twenty-four runs, six different machines and thirty-rivals. runs good design (the action takes place mainly in the beautifully executed tunnels, graphics are not bad at all), the complexity is relatively high (can easily be lost), but in this game there is nothing this, unfortunately, that it would stand out from the dozens of other similar ones.

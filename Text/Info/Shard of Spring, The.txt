Quietly released by SSI in 1986 and 1987 were 2 PC conversions of their classic Apple II RPGs: Demon"s Winter and The Shard of Spring.Both games are solid "conventional" RPGs (i.e. top-down view, lots of loot and monsters) which emphasizes level advancement and typical "kill the big foozle" endgame. In Demon"s Winter, you must search the lands and seas for spells to trap the demon-god Malifon and undo his mystical curse. Entertaining and very well-written, if not revolutionary.

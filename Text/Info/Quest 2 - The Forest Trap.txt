The sequel to the Quest game above, this one looks even cooler. The gameplay is now more balanced, there"s more stuff to do, and the graphics look even better! (The screenshot doesn"t do it justice!) Quite incredible for just a 144k zipfile! Can"t wait for part 3.

The sequel to Quest. This game boasts new monsters, graphics and includes some animation of the characters. This game is basically a much improved version of the first Quest and personally my favorite of the two.

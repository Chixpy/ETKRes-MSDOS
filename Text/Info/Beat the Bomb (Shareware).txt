Addition practice drills are boring, right? Well, yeah, they are. Were you expecting me to say that this program makes them fun? Well, in all honesty, no, it doesn"t. But its still a well made program with a decent interface. Students can practice their addition skills by answering simple addition problems while racing against a snail, bomb or by gradually building a castle as they answer questions. Not too exciting but no doubt good arithmetic practice.

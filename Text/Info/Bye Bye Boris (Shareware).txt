"You are Boris Smirnoff and your only goal in life is to take a one way vacation to America.

Unfortunately, you have been invited to a party, the Government"s Party. You"ll need to buy, borrow & barter in order to get the necessary items and board your flight to the U.S.A. before the KGB discovers you.

Somehow you must obtain the following: A U.S. passport, a new suitcase, a pair of designer jeans and a baseball cap (a disguise?!) as well as 300 rubles for an airline ticket to Miami, the land of your dreams.

Oh yes, beware of the KGB... they are everywhere. One wrong move and it"s Bye Bye Boris!"

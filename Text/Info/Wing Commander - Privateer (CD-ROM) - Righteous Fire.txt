"Righteous Fire" is a little-seen add-on disk for the original Wing Commander: Privateer, it added a new plot line with the religious zealot "Retros" out for conquest, along with more weapons and goodies to buy for your ship. It was also included in the full talkie Privateer CD-ROM.

The CD-ROM version of Wing Commander: Privateer is similar to the original but actually features the following products:

- Wing Commander: Privateer
- Wing Commander: Privateer - Righteous Fire
- Digitized speech for every character, a feature which expands on  what was available in the Wing Commander: Privateer - Speech Pack

Setting the scene for a shoot-"em-up game is always a stiff proposition and never anywhere more so than here: due to hitherto unknown properties of hamster urine leeching into the water supply, humanity is rendered telepathic and besieged by enormous symbols of repressed desire and Freudian hang-ups.

Proving once again that nothing is less sexy than a sexuality-themed video game, this crude premise is intended to explain why you, the player, are in charge of eliminating an army of "Bouncing Birth-Control Pills", "Bibles (Straight from the South)", "AIDS Virii" (a cutting-edge inclusion at the game"s release), and, yes, the eponymous lactating "Astro Tits", with the assistance of a (chew on this, Zombie Nation) ghoulishly disembodied phallus.  (Yes, by shooting wriggling spermatozoa (with eyes!) into them.)  All in front of stunning 4-colour CGA renditions of Moon Patrol-style sci-fi lunar landscapes!

HEARTS is a very easy card game to play and one that will give you many hours of enjoyment. The rules for this game are quite simple. After the cards are shuffled, they are dealt clockwise to each player. There are four players in this game with each receiving 13 cards (a total of 52). The direction of play, like most card games, is clockwise around the table. A player must always match the SUIT of the first card in play. If a player does not have the LEAD suit then he or she can play any card in their hand. The cards are RANKED in descending value from the Ace to the 2 with the Ace being the HIGHEST rank. The player having the highest ranked card in the lead suit takes that TRICK and BEGINS play on the next trick. There are four cards in each trick (one from each player) and 13 tricks per hand.

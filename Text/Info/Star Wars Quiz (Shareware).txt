"STAR WARS - The first film in the series, was originally released at the cinema in 1977, then THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK came out in 1980, followed by RETURN OF THE JEDI in 1983. Now after 20 years since the first film, the STAR WARS trilogy is back, with special added features of digitally remastered soundtracks, restored prints, enhanced visual effects, and a few new surprises. And as a tribute to the new updated trilogy, i"ve knocked together this quiz with questions related to the three star wars films. Each question has three possible answers, only one of which is the correct answer. You score a point for each answer guessed correctly. The questions are displayed at random, so there"s no particular sequence.

May the force be with you...."

Planet"s Edge is a game from the creators of Might and Magic, featuring resource collection, space combat, and RPG aspects as your team explores different planets. Space-combat is real-time, while ground-combat is turn-based. Your group travels the local region of space, interacting with various alien races and gathering equipment.

The story of Planet"s Edge is best described as a "space opera". After discovery of an alien craft entering our solar system causes quite a stir, but when the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical earth simply isn"t there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, construct a interstellar ship and a team (the players) to find unique parts to construct a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.

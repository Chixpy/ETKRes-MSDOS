"Baccarat... one of my favorite casino games. Many people shy away from the game because they don"t understand the rules. Actually there isn"t much to understand except two things.

1. How much do you want bet?
2. Which side do you want to bet on?

The rules of Baccarat are preset and you don"t have a choice on how you play the hand. We are going to be talking about the Mini-Baccarat game where the house does all the dealing. You"ll find these games scattered about the Blackjack tables in most casino clubs in Reno, Lake Tahoe and Lost Wages.

The cards contain eight 52-card packs shuffled together and they are dealt from a box called a shoe. The shoe releases one card at a time as the dealer deals from it. It"s a piece a cake. After the cut, the dealer will wait until all bets have been made before dealing. If you happen to be the only one sitting at the table, you must bet. You are not required to make a bet as long as there is more than one player at the table."

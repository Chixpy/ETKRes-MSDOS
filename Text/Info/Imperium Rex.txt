"This is basically a world domination game: Your goal is to take over and rule all of civilization (for the good of the people). Strategy, tactics, and logistics all play a role in the success of your empire. You will start by ruling one city and having ownership of just a few objects. Then, you will seek out the establishments of your opponents and forcefully persuade them to follow your cause (since there is no time to reason with them). However, the largest and most powerful of your prey are an alliance that stands for freedom and independent rule, and resists change with all their might: the Neutral Player (NP).

The actual introductory story is presented to you as you begin a new game - the one presented here is an extremely abbreviated version.

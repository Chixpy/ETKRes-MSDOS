An interesting puzzle game where you must complete multiple tasks in order to win the game.  You are in a dungeon and must collect 10,000 points before receiving your first objective.  To collect points, you must collect diamonds and crush your enemies.  While doing so, you must avoid running out of oxygen by collecting oxygen tanks, and you must break through walls using TNT that you find along the way.

The game is played in a 25 room map.  Once you get the 10,000 points and receive your first objective, you learn why you are really here... a maiden in distress named Eve.  But there is more... play the game to find out all the various objectives you must complete to win the game.

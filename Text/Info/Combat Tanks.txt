Combat Tanks is a fun 2D tank combat game. You must destroy all the enemies and go on to the next level. You can play by yourself or against a friend on the same PC.

Enemies include tanks (obviously), bazooka toting infrantry, bomber planes, and death choppers.

Its distributed as shareware, and in the unregistered version the death chopper comes after you until you register the game (see screenshots).

You are lost, on Hallowe"en Night!
 
And the only way out of an endless back alley is through a decrepid old house known only to few as Mordred Manor.
 
Are you prepared, in the course of your adventures, to deal with an insane maestro, a sleepy skeleton, a mad scientist and his strangely familiar creation, and a bizarre chef, who would be delighted to have you for dinner...once you are properly cooked, of course.
 
 Mordred Manor awaits.  Do you dare enter?

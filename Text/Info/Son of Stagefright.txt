This is text adventure game with a theatrical twist.  Things just aren"t going right for you. For starters, you"re locked inside an old abandoned theater. The little voice inside you is telling you: YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! As you try to get out, you"ll encounter creaky catwalks, raging rivers, mini mazes, rogues, rats and a zoo keeper. You"ll also endure puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and some mild innuendo.

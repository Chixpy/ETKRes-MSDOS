BIG THREE is  the ultimate WWII strategy  game. You control all the  action from  the desolate fiords  of Norway  to the scorching  sands  of  Egypt,  from  the  strategic Rock  of Gibralter  to the  frozen streets  of Moscow.   Recreate the epic and  fiercely fought battles of  Tobruk and Stalingrad. Decide to  open your second  front in Normandy or  the "soft underbelly" of  Europe (Italy). Build bombers to  hit your opponent"s cities  or build  tanks and fighters  to encircle and destroy  his armies at  the front. BIG THREE  gives you all this in an easy-to-use format plus excellent graphics.

Each player assumes  supreme command of the  Axis, Allied or Soviet  forces  in  Europe during  1939-1945.   Players  can choose from three scenarios (register today and receive four addition scenarios  plus a scenario editor)  or a previously saved  game. Players  that  perform  better   than  their historical  counterparts will normally win  and those  that under perform will normally lose.

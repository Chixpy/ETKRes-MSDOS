This turn-based C&C/X-Com hybrid puts you in command of an extensive array of modern-day sounding troops, needing to play battle after battle against the merciless hordes of fantastical creatures (orcs, elves, skeletons, etc.) in an attempt to save the world. As the game progresses your selection of troops increase and you, hopefully, gain rank and lead your troops into trickier and trickier battles. Only you can save mankind!

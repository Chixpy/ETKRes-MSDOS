Richard Wong"s Brickwar is our version of the arcade classic, Breakout. For most of you, then, Brickwar needs no introduction. However, for those of you who have spent the last 15 years breeding llamas in the Peruvian Andes, or who started computing too late to become infected with nostalgia for the Classics, here"s an overview of the game:

Two brick walls are displayed on the Brickwar playing screen -- the top wall belongs to your opponent (either Player Two or the computer); you defend the bottom. Between these two walls are from one to fifteen bouncing balls. Any time a ball touches a wall, it shatters some of the bricks. Each player controls a paddle to deflect balls from their own barricade and redirect them toward their opponent"s wall. If your wall is breached, you lose.

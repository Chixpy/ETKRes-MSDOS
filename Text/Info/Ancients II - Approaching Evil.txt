Ancients 2: Approaching Evil is the sequel to Ancients 1: Death Watch with a new story not directly connected to its predecessor. A new evil has arisen from ancient catacombs and the player"s task is to find four seals to contain it in these catacombs.

The party is created from six classes (warrior, rogue, priest, mage and the new paladin and ranger) and five races (human, elf, dwarf and the new half-elf and hobbit) and heads straight into the dungeon. The gameplay mechanics didn"t change compared to the predecessor, there is still a main city which serves to buy equipment and heal up. 

New is that not all dungeons are just in the city"s underground, players also visit places like the wilderness or a wizard"s tower. Combat is turn-based and character development is based on experience points.

VGA-RENJU is a variation of the game of Go, an ancient game from the Orient. Go has been played for at least 2000 years and is considered the most popular game in the world today. Despite this, Go is not very well known in North America. Go is a game of position played on a board of 19 vertical lines and 19 horizontal lines. The intersections of these lines are called points and this is where the players place the game pieces known as stones. Go is a very complex game which challenges Chess in terms of movement strategy. VGA-RENJU is modelled after a simpler variation known by many names including: Renju, Moku and Go-Moku.

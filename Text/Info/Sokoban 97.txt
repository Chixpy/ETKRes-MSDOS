"The Japanese word ""Sokoban"" (see introduction screen of Sokoban if you want to know how it is written in kanji) means ""warehouse keeper"". 

There are numerous variants of this program for different operating systems. Originally, it was developed by Japanese programmers who won an award with it in the early eighties. Levels 1 to 50 are the original Sokoban mazes, taken from the first Sokoban program for the PC which I encountered in 1992, a freeware program by Alan B. Liss.

My version is programmed using Borland Delphi 1.0. Levels 51 to 90 are from the Unix program XSokoban, which also uses the 50 original levels and adds 40 more freeware levels.

Allan B. Liss writes: ""If you complete all 50 levels, there won"t be any fireworks, just that warm fuzzy feeling of satisfaction one gets when one overcomes a challenge. You could always give Mensa a call or something.""

Well, the puzzles are not quite as difficult that you must be a Mensa member to complete them, and you can be assured, each of the 90 levels can be solved, but some of them are very, very hard."

Poor Roger Wilco. While our ace-janitor was taking a nap in the utility closet, the evil Sariens attacked the starship Arcada, murdered the rest of the crew, and stole the Star Generator. This is a tool that can turn a barren moon into a blazing sun, but I bet I the Sariens" intentions are a lot less noble. Now it"s up to Roger to stop them. The future of the galaxy lies in his, rather clumsy, hands! But first you"ll have to find a way for Roger to get off the Arcada before it explodes. You have fifteen minutes...

Space Quest 1: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter is a remake of the original release of Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter. It is a humorous adventure game. The new version has enhanced graphics, soundblaster support and uses the SCI game engine (point-and-click interface, icons along the top) rather than the AGI engine (mixed point-and-click with text parser). Some of the puzzles have also been changed.

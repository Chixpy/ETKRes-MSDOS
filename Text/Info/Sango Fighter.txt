Sango Fighter is a fighting game from Panda Entertainment, in which you control 5 different characters and fight other characters in either a one on one combat or a "story mode".

The story is this: towards the end of the Han Dynasty, the world was controlled by the Emperor Ling, who was in turn controlled by 10 of his servants in the royal palace. This created a convenient atmosphere for bandits, and the land was in turmoil. Then the Emperor ordered the 10 dukes to take it on themselves to restore peace in the land, but the dukes instead fought amongst themselves. Finally, the duke Tsao Tsao took the Emperor captive and he now controls the realm. You, however, must use your five fighters to take on duke Tsao Tsao"s forces and restore equilibrium to the land.

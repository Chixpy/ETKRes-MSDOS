Puzzle Beauty is a so-so Tetris variant developed by Dynasty International, famous (in Asia) Taiwan company whose Flame Dragon series consistently rank among some of the best-selling games in Asia.One of their first commercial titles, Puzzle Beauty is little more than Xixit with adult theme. Your job, as we have seen in dozens of other games, is to match three stones of the same color to make them disappear. Once you clear the screen, you will be treated to nude/semi-nude pictures of women drawn in anime style before moving on to the next, faster level. If you like X-Tetris or other adult-themed puzzlers, there is no reason to dislike Puzzle Beauty. It is competently coded, looks nice, and plays reasonably well. The trouble is that it offers nothing except the adult content to broaden the genre, and therefore will not appeal to fans of innovative puzzlers. All in all, a decent game you could do without - except of course if you are one of those gamers who simply must collect every adult-themed game ever made ;)

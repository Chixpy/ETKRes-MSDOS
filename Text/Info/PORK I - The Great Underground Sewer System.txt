PORK is a parody of the classic Infocom text adventure ZORK I THE GREAT UNDERGROUND EMPIRE which was written by "Diabolical" Dave Lebling and "Maniacal" Marc Blank and originally published by Infocom in 1981. ZORK has sold more copies than any other adventure game (and probably more copies than any other program -- period). It is truly a classic! In writing PORK I have tried to retain some of the cleverness low cunning and humor of ZORK -- while poking a little good-natured fun at it.

This game is an interactive adventure through the human body.  You can zoom down the spinal column, watch blood cells flow through veins, and climb down the brain all in the same day.  An interactive encyclopedia helps you understand different things relating to the human body that you might not know.  If that doesn"t satisfy you, perhaps some of the games will.  Answer questions about the human body, germs, and health.  If you want a little action, try to save a ER patient by zooming through their body and fighting germs.

The whole thing comes wrapped up on a CD-ROM, or three floppy disks.

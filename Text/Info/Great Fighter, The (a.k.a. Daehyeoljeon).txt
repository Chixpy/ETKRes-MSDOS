While more playable than most of its PC contemporaries, Sigmatek"s first fighting game still doesn"t hold a candle against the likes of Super Street Fighter II Turbo or King of Fighters. The mechanics are much too basic, and the controls are 2nd tier as well. Then there"s only 8 playable characters and no bosses, which was already much too few in the eyes of most people by 1995.

Character sprites are dotted quite well, even though most don"t convey much personality. The backgrounds are hideous, though, because SigmaTec already began to make a transfer to prerendered graphics, which should foreshadow the looks of many of their later games.

Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament is the second game in the Micro Machines series. Like its predecessor, it puts the player behind the steering wheel of an extremely small car. The races take place in locations such as a table, a treehouse, and many more.

The CD-ROM version adds CD-audio music and a track editor, while the Mega Drive (Genesis) version features a special cartridge that allows players to connect two additional controllers to the console for four-player games.

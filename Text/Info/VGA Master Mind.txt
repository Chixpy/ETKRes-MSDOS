VGA_MIND version 1.0 was written October 13th, 1992.  It uses VGA graphics and requires the included Borland Graphics Interface video driver.

The program was coded in Turbo Pascal v6.0  The program was tested only on my 386-33 mhz with the Trident 8900 video card.  Turbo Pascal interprets the video setup as mode=2 & driver=9.  VGA_MIND will not run unless the VGA mode is accessible.  Leave the .BGI driver file in the same directory as VGA_MIND.exe.

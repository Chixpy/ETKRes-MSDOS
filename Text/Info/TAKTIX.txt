TAKTIX is a strategy game for two players or one player playing against the computer. Moves consist of placing or moving pieces in a seven by seven square playing field. To make a move, first select a square already occupied by a piece of your color. You may either place a new piece in an adjacent square or move the selected piece to a new location two squares away. In other words, a move to another square touching the first square you select will create a new piece, while choosing a second location two spaces away will transfer the piece to that square and leave the first square empty. All enemy pieces touching the square you move to will be captured and changed to your color. Diagonal moves and captures are allowed. Play continues in this way until the board is full, no moves can be made, or one player has been eliminated.

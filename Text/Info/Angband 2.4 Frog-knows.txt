The game of  Angband is  a single player  dungeon  simulation.  A player  may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a character, and then `run" that character over a  period  of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth who lurks in the deeper levels.

The player will begin his adventure on the town  level  where  he may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop owners.  After preparing for his  adventure,  the  player can  descend into the Pits of Angband where fantastic adventures await his coming!

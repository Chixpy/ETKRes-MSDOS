The idea behind jump is that you have to keep the bouncing ball on the moving surface.
 
Special tiles on the surface have specific actions, like:

A double arrow : invert the world movement from up to down and vice versa.

A black hole : jump into a black hole and reappear somewhere else.

A toggle/switch : jump on a toggle to create or destroy some part of the world, etc.

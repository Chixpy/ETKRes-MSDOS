Hong Gildong-jeon 2 is a follow-up to Hong Gildong-jeon. Like its predecessor, it is based on the classic Korean tale of a boy who is persecuted by his own family and grows up to become a noble-hearted bandit and a hero. Unlike the first game, it is an interactive cartoon movie similar to Dragon"s Lair. The player watches short animated scenes depicting various dangers and hazards (some of them comical) occurring to Hong Gildong, and presses directional arrows combined with the action key at the right moments in order to trigger the next scene.

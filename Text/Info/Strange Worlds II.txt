Strange Worlds was so popular that we had to release a Strange Worlds II. Once again, five different choices of graphics, full-screen capacity, textured ceilings and floors, interesting enemies with amusing and rational AI, 22 maps, and level after level of thrills and action, all combine to make this game an extraordinary experience.

Essentially a "one hit wonder" company, Baudville released many sub-par adventure games in mid 80s, except this game which turns out to be a surprisingly interesting adventure about the influences of dreams on our lives.

As the name suggests, you will travel through the various "dreamzones," each with its own character and coded metaphors about your real life. Some puzzles are annoying, and there are many horrible deaths to die, but the weird plot manages to carry the game right to the end.

If you own a computer and have a young child between 6 to 24 months of age, then you have probably noticed that he has a certain curiosity about that strange looking box sitting on your desk. Children naturally have an attraction to it and find the keyboard to be irresistible. It would be a shame to let that interest and energy go to waste. This is where "Baby Keys" comes in. When "Baby Keys" is running, all your child has to do is hit the keys on the keyboard (this comes naturally). The computer will produce a variety of sounds accompanied with graphical images that will capture her attention (at least for a few minutes).

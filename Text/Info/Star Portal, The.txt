The Star Portal is a text adventure created with AGT.

The earth is recovering from a time of unrest and the exploration of the solar system has halted. You are the adventuring type, the one that goes of to exotic places and searches for treasures. While having a drink in one of the local pubs, you got into a conversation with a fellow who had obviously been drinking too much. During the conversation he made several references to a secret installation on Mars, and the alien artifact within it. After that night you spent six month and most of your money to track down the truth to this rumor. You found a member of the third martian expedition, the expedition that found the artifact, who tells you the story about it. It looks like a large vid-phone booth, but with a single lever inside it instead of a phone. It turns out that this seems to be a sort of teleporter, sending things to random, far of locations. Some locations are so far away that it takes radio waves five or eight years to reach the earth. The WorldGow got scared and suppressed the story and a guarded building was constructed around the artifact.

You set of to mars aboard a supply ship for the only guard at the installation. The ship did not land at the artifact and most of your equipment was lost during a sand storm. You are now in the middle of the martian desert and you have to find your way to the installation and see what you can do with the artifact.

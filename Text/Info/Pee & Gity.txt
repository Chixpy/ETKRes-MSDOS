Pee & Gity is a Korean-made brawler. The two titular protagonists are anthropomorphic animals who return to their quiet rural house only to find it invaded by enemies. The game allows the player to choose between Pee and Gity, or join forces in the two-player mode, controlling both characters. 

As opposed to most beat-em-up games, the action is confined to small areas with limited scrolling, like in versus fighters; defeating all the enemies in the stage automatically takes the player to the next one. Stages can feature regular enemies or bosses. Both protagonists fight by punching enemies, or combining attacks by jumping or dashing. They can also pick up various objects (such as stones) and throw them at enemies. Special orbs can be collected; once a sufficient amount has been accumulated, Pee and Gity transform into powerful robotic creatures.

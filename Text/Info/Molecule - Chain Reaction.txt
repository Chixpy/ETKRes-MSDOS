Molecule is a simple but fun computerized board game for 1 to 4 players.Each player takes a turn adding a ball to the board. Each square can hold a maximum number of balls equal to the number of adjacent squares. When a square overflows, a ball is sent in each direction "capturing" the square. Those may also overflow causing a chain-reaction. Simple, but quite enjoyable, especially since the computer puts up more than a decent fight if you can"t find other human players to compete against. Well worth a look, at least for its novel concepts.

The Advanced Players Edition of Clonk is an improved version of the original Clonk game.

As in the first Clonk game, Clonk A.P.E. included the player roster concept, which remembers each player"s data and statistics over time.

Instead of the predefined rounds of the original Clonk, the player can choose to play a randomly generated scenario, or customize one yourself. Further, the maximum number of players has been raised to 4 players simultaneously, and a couple of introductory tutorial rounds are available.

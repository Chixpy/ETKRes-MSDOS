Sid Meier"s Pirates! remains to this day one of the most famous strategy games ever made.A lot of people were disappointed when MicroProse released a poor remake called Pirates! Gold in 1993, and felt the game could have been much better. 

One fan of the original Pirates! game, Marcel Strbak, decided to "re-program" the original game and add many new features, such as an improved dating options, more realistic weather, the ablility to angle your cannons, and other features. Called Pirates 2, this game is available as freewere. A registration can be obtained just by sending an e-mail, and the game is not crippled in any way. The final version, however, is not yet finished -- the help files are only half complete and the game has funny memory needs that may crash the program on some computers. Once it becomes fully playable, the final version should be a godsend to those who love the original Pirates!. Overall, a great private effort and highly recommended, but keep an eye out for future updates!

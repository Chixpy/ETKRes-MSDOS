Upon awakening, you don\u2019t know much. Your name is Mason Powers. You used to work for the CIA. But what has happened in the last days? What case have you been working on? And most important: Why are you locked away in this cold, barren prison cell? Time to find some answers.

In Access Software\u2019s interactive thriller, you dive into the world of the secret services. Travel around Europe, interrogate suspects, try to outwit other spies. As agent Mason Powers, you have to prevent a global disaster and expose a mole inside the \u201ccompany\u201d. Piece after piece, you regain your memory, remembering the events of that night in which your chief was murdered. You are the suspect. But to prove your innocence, you\u2019ve first got escape from that godforsaken sanatorium they keep you locked in.

Countdown continues Access Software\u2019s then-habit of using digitized actors in its games. 

The game contains a time limit -- you have to solve the mystery in 96 hours.

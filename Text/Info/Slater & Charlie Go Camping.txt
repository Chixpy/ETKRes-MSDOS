A colorful and fun interactive storybook similar to Broderbund"s later Living Books series, Slater & Charlie Go Camping recounts the story of two amicable dinosaurs as they prepare to go camping.Each page contains many "hot spots" kids can click on for animations and sounds. The pace is just right and the story is easy to follow, although it is very short with too few interactive "hot spots" to warrant replay.

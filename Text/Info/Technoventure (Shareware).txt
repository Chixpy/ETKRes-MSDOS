Technoventure is a strange side-scrolling action/adventure game. The plot, and entire game really, is a bit strange, but still oddly compelling. It does include many different gameplay elements like bombs, coins, swords, keys, and many people to talk to and signs to read. The graphics are nothing special but it"s certainly a unique game. (Note: Press and hold the right arrow key to speed up the text messages which scroll often during the game.)

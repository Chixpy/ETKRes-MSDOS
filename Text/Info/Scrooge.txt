First in Leisuresoft"s "Leisureland" adventure game series, Scrooge is an easy adventure games starring Ebenezer Scrooge, the miser millionnaire who lived in the 19th century.Scrooge has a fun premise: it"s your job to convince Scrooge to give more than he takes on Christmas day. gamesplay involves selecting which items to use in each location and what action you want Scrooge to perform from the multiple choices-- similar to choose-your-own-adventure books. The huge dose of randomness makes it frustrating, as many items must be used without any prior clues, and many times you will find that items you used in the wrong place cannot be retrieved-- no way out but to load the saved games. Still, it"s a mildly entertaining games with a good sense of humor if you can stick with it, but anyone looking for a serious and logical adventure should look elsewhere. Good for budding adventurers who are learning to read and don"t mind illogical puzzles and random elements.

Another rarity Spanish game (even surpasses the rarity Cefalus ). By the way - it is very similar to Cefalus , but there are also significant differences. effect seems to occur in the ancient Egyptian pyramids, which decided to rob our hero Plunderer (small little man with a mustache, consisting only of the head and tiny legs, but armed with an infinite number of charges for killing enemies). Game consists of levels, but now the screen is scrolling, you can go back. Each screen - a kind of labyrinth, therefore, in addition to killing enemies, you will still find a way out of it (but nothing difficult to do so). Some passages are covered with blue doors for areas to look for bonus keys to open them (and the same thing - for areas with chests and goals of your stay here.) Enemies are mummies" heads and dragons (probably Anubis), skulls, ghosts , snakes, and so on. All of them are killed with a single shot, but, unlike Cefalus , here in physical contact with them does not lead to immediate death of the hero, as he has a "strip" of life. It is quite large, in addition to its present make up bonuses in the form of hearts. Time limit for passing the no. Killing monsters get points. Graphics - still only a CGA, is setting in general, only the wall of the maze, but that enemies themselves and the effects of explosions in their death drawn well. As Cefalus , the game runs at high speed and requires a player to a great response, both in terms of marksmanship, and in terms of deviation from the contact with the enemy (though, of course, because of the "vitality" of the hero and the lack of a time limit Faraonik easier .) game is huge rarity, not online, and because of this is of great interest not only for the fans of the old arcade complex, but for collectors. PS: The game in Spanish, but the text in it is only in the menu, and short text messages .

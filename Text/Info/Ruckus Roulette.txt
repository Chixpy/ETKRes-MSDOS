Ruckus Poker and Ruckus Roulette are two of the best entries in Villa Crespo"s long line of casino games that found their heyday in early 1990s.Marketed as full-price commercial titles rather than as releases in their "coffee break" budget games series, both Ruckus games are well worth the price tag. Both games support up to 4 players in turn-based gameplay, decent graphics, and best of all - a plethora of options that gambling fans will be delighted with, including variants, comprehensive rules, and scoring options. If you enjoy poker or roulette, these games are some of the best games of their kind you can find. Recommended.

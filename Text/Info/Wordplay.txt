"Like many of my friends, and apparently a lot of people across the country, I found myself becoming addicted to the ""Wheel of Fortune"" game on television. My addiction was related to solving the puzzles. Yes, I like watching Vanna White turn letters and I enjoy Pat Sajak"s charm but I really didn"t care who won the game and I certainly didn"t care who won the ceramic Dalmatian. And how many people do you know who would spend $14,000 for a watch? Give me a break please! I just wanted to solve the puzzle"s. To overcome these distractions I began video taping the show and watching it later so that I could fast forward through all but the puzzle solving. Having now reduced this game to it"s basics , it occurred to me that it should be a simple thing to write a computer program to do the puzzles.

Well, it wasn"t that simple but that"s what I did and that"s what this is. Funny thing, now that I"ve written it I wish I could figure out how to get Vanna to turn the letters."

PC*Bert is an excellent fanmade remake of Atari/Parker Brothers" Q*Bert, one of the most classic arcade games of all time.The gameplay is the same, and the controls are just as simple as in the original. Like all other arcade classics, the goal in the game is simple, but hard to master: you must change all the cubes to the same color to clear the level by moving a cute little creature called PC*Bert around the pyramid of cubes. Each time PC*Bert lands on a new cube, the cube changes color. You must be careful not to fall off the pyramid while moving, as well.

To make matters more complicated, some levels will add moving obstacles that will knock you off of the pyramid if they hit you, including the colored balls that will bonk PC*Bert on the head, and nasty purple balls that turn into coily snakes once they make it to the bottom of the puzzle. In the higher levels the cubes will change back to their original colors if you land on them a second time. Fortunately, you can also make use of special items, such as the flying disc that will whisk PC*Bert back to the top of the pyramid.

With attractive graphics and excellent gameplay that is very faithful to the original, PC*Bert is a must-have for any fan of the original, and anyone else looking for a pleasant diversion that requires both reflexes and some planning to succeed. Two thumbs up, way up!

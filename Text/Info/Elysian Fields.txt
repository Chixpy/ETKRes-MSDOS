This is the full version of Elysian Fields, one of the best QBasic RPG"s ever made. You may distribute this game, as long as you do not edit any of the files. Feel free to post it up on your web page, but please tell me, so that I can link your page. This game has several different characters (and a secret character), magics, items, weapons, armors, etc. I can go on forever. This game took several months (more than six) to complete. The towns are all detailed, with several stores, inns, etc. This game is packed with animation sequences, and slide shows, all with very impressive graphics. The storyline of this game is great. You are not against only one person, or one group of people. You will encounter many enemies who will give you a hard time. Elysian Fields is the only Qbasic RPG that will give you hours and hours of RPG glory.

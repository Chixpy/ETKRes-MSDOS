Taxi Run is one of many games that take inspiration from the original Pipe Mania (aka Pipe Dreams) game. The object is to rotate the road pieces to guide your taxi to pick up your fare, and then guide it to their intended destination. As you progress through the levels the challenges get progressively more difficult. The game plays pretty well using the mouse, my only complaint is that you need to scroll around to see the entire map/playing field. Generally a good game similar to other Soleau releases like Ant Run.

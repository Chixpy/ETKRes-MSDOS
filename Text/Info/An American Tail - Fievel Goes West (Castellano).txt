An American Tail: Fievel Goes West is a point-and-click adventure game based on the Steven Spielberg movies An American Tail and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West. At the beginning of the 20th century, Fievel Mousekwitz is a young Russian mouse emigrating across the ocean to America. During a storm at sea, he was tossed overboard and lands at New York City away from his family. He must now wander the streets, and interact with other mice and cats in order to become reunited with his family. And once that happens, the Mousekwitz family have always talked about moving west, onto the Frontier.

You take the role of Fievel, a mouse in a blue hat, who then moves between areas picking up and interacting with items and characters. Fievel can store an unlimited number of items in his inventory and must use these to solve various puzzles & mini-games in order to progress.

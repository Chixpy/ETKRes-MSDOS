Despite its simple stick graphics, this game is actually quite enjoyable, as long as you don"t take it too seriously. The game involves shooting robots while avoiding various other objects, like rolling logs and UFOs. The death scenes when your character dies are rather amusing ... it"s just in fun of course, these are just stick characters. :)

Word Hunt is basically a word search-and-find puzzle program. In this puzzle a square grid filled with letters is displayed on the screen along with a list of words. The object of the game is to find all the words on the list. These words can be in any direction, forward, backward, up or down but always in a straight line. The program can provide different levels of play. The playing level determines the size of the grid as well as the number of directions the words could be placed in. The program comes with a data file of approximately 1400 words that are used in creating the puzzle. The words are randomly chosen from the file. The user can also enter their own words (up to 20) from which the program will create the puzzle. The program provides a number of special features. These include the ability to: save a puzzle to be completed later, change screen colors, print the puzzle or save it as an ASCII text file, and a Boss key to display a fake DOS screen. There are no special hardware requirements for the program. The game can be run off a single floppy disk and can be run in color or monochrome mode.

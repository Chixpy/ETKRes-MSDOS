This game allows the player to control a simulated United States attack submarine.  The game is played in a hybrid turn-based/real-time mode -- there are turns, but there is a timer on each turn, so the player needs to act quickly.  The screen displays a large amount of information on the current situation, and the player must use menu commands to perform actions such as moving, targeting, firing and using radar or sonar.

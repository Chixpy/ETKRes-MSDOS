Econ"s Arena is a tactical game in which the four ancient elements (fire, water, earth, air) are fighting each other. Every element has unique troops which differ in moving range, life energy and combat strength. To win the game you either have to defeat the other elements or find three of your own tokens which appear regularly on the game field and are guarded by a warden.

The field is divided into five areas: Four triangles are the "homelands" of the elements in which the own troops regenerate. The rest are neutral zones. The two outer rows of each triangle rotate after every round clockwise so that every eight rounds the field is again in the original shape. Then every player may revive a dead unit or refresh a used spell. It is possible to set the enemy"s AI to a special attribute like "collector" or "conqueror".

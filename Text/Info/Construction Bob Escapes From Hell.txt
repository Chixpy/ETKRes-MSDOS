The all-star favorite construction stuntman is back! Trying to outperform his latest stunt, Construction Bob takes a giant leap into the mysterious bottomless pit. Realizing too late this pit leads directly to hell, Construction Bob will have to use all his bouncing energy to get out of the place where none ever came back!

The fans of the original Construction Bob won"t be disappointed, because Construction Bob retains all the simplicity of the original, but includes a greater variety of events! Dodge coal-filled carts in the mine shaft, jump over holes and rocks in the cart track, and finally, avoid drops of poisonous water, and jump over daemonic hands over the pitchfork bridge! Gather all of Satan"s ruby, and use them to open the gate out! Smooth scrolling and animations as well as easy to learn controls makes this the ideal game for the entire family! No weapons means virtually no violence. Leaping and dodging are Bob"s only friends, and he will need them to escape from hell!

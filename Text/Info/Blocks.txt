This game is virtually identical to the popular online game Collapse (or any of the many other similar games). The object is to click on groups of three or more colored blocks. When clicked, groups of blocks disappear, and any blocks on top of those fall down to take the place of the ones that disappeared. A fun game for a brief time, but I can"t see anyone playing a lot unless they"re a big fan of this kind of game. (Note: The game is written in French but it"s pretty easy to figure out what to do, look at blocks.diz for instructions if you need help in English. You have to use a mouse to play this game!)

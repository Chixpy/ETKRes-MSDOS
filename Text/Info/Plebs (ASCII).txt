Plebs (with "(ASCII)" to differentiate it from the other game on DOSGames.com with the same name) is a strange text-mode game where the object is to bomb various targets using your plane. Even after reading the instructions within the game, I still am confused as to the premise. I can tell you, for example, that the game takes place in the year 45983674745623746 AD and that PLEBS stands for Publicly Licensed Electronic Burden Shifters, but ... um just read the instructions, they may be more entertaining than the game. It"s certainly unique!

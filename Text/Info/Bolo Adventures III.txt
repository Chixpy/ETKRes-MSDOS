The final part of the Bolo Adventures trilogy, this game has updated graphics and only 30 levels instead of the 40 in Bolo Adventure I and II. The objective remains the same, though - escape from each level by maneuvering blocks to fill in water, shut off laser beams and avoiding monsters. A demo level is provided, with a walkthrough to help introduce the game concept for new players.

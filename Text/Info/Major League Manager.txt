As the name implies you get to run your own baseball team. You play as a sort of all powerful coach with complete control over your team; you do want to have players who can play well though, you can trade, delete, and create new players at will, and you don"t have to worry about labor strikes. You can decide where to put all your players, you can tell them what plays to play. All of this is done with real names of real baseball players and real teams. Graphics are colored ASCII.

Duracell: Run the Bunny is a pretty awful first-person shooter starring -- yes, it"s true -- Duracell"s Energizer bunny, one of the most recognizable corporate mascots in the world.The goal in each level is to find the two drumsticks, a drum, and a Duracell battery to bring to the Energizer bunny so he can start -- drumming (ugh), thereby opening the way for you to the next level. The graphics, gameplay, and even sounds are pretty awful? and I suspect that the dozens of Duracell bunnies you come across in the game may cause epilepsy :P If you simply must have every FPS game in existence, then you"ll probably download this Real Dog no matter what I say. But if you value your sanity, you"ll stay as far away from this awful game as possible. Definitely one of the worst promotional games ever made. If you can manage to tolerate it long enough to finish all 6 terrible levels, you can probably play any FPS game in existence without feeling nauseated :P

This is a parody of the Sierra-style games like Space Quest, King"s Quest, etc. Similar interface, sounds, and graphics. 

This is a small game that"ll make people who have played the Sierra games laugh, although I don"t think anybody else will understand the point. Probably R-Rated because of not-so-subtle sexual content. Can be finished quickly.

Action tank game in which your goal is to destroy enemy Vehicles, Airplanes, Turrets, Migs and Enemy Bases through 12 unique levels. Requires DOS 6 & P100 CPU.

Kondor is an action tank game in which your goal is to destroy enemy Vehicles, Airplanes, Turrets, Migs and Enemy Bases through 12 unique levels.

It is slightly clunky due to its DOS heritage though there is a special program supplied, called KONDOR-FAST.EXE, to assist if the game is running too slow or is too jerky. While we did find it a little jerky, it is extremely enjoyable and quite addictive once you get the feel of the controls.

As all the keys are mapped separately, you will find that you can only use one of the Enter keys, which can be a right pain in the you-know-what if you are used to using the other one.

There were no sounds available to us, even though it was mentioned in the options and we do have a genuine SoundBlaster card, but computer hardware can be flaky and you might find excellent sounds on your equipment.

The graphics were quite good, in a DOS sort of way, and the animation a little jerky (as we mentioned above).

Who cares! The game is fun and addictive, what more could you want?

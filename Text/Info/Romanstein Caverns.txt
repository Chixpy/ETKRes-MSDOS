Gary has created a Wolfmod game that combines the Romanstein graphics with his own graphics and the graphics from many of the best Wolfmods today, with all the latest features, such as full-screen capacity and fast-loading title screen. This time the beauties are in Romanstein Caverns wherein you are trapped and must escape through level after level of exploration and battle.

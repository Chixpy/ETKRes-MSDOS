This is the second adventure in which the player takes on the role of the Inspector, a crime-solving fighter/mage.  This time around, an apprentice at a school of wizardry has been murdered, and the player must investigate and find the culprit.  The player must move around a rather tiny map of his or her surroundings, searching for clues, talking to other characters and occasionally fighting enemies through a menu-based combat system.  There are items to collect and equip, experience points to gain, spells to cast and, of course, a crime to solve.

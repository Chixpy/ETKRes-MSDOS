Epic Baseball is a baseball management and coaching simulator. The game allows for Exhibition Play as well as League Play. In Exhibition play you will select both teams playing and where they"re playing. In League Play you will guide a single team through the majors. There are also options to modify schedules and playbooks. Once a game starts, you as the coach, can select who will play and how they will play. The action on the field is automatic but you will determine for example whether a hitter will play aggressively or will bunt and whether a pitcher will throw curves or ball the player to base. The game"s graphical depictions of baseball are optional and a coach can simply opt out of them and see the final scores.

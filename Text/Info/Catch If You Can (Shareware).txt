The game is sort of like a Pong type game mixed in with a baseball type theme. Sounds weird? Well, it is ... but it"s fun to play, despite its simple premise. Basically, all you do is catch baseballs. The graphics are very good, the control is excellent, and there"s some cool sound effects (including voices) as well. Definitely fun to play ... it feels like an old arcade classic type of game.

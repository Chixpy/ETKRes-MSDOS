Currently, Rubber Man is a game. Based in a suburban neighborhood called San Nihil, it is any time you want it to be. Generally the point is kill or be killed, but it uses a unique approach in the sense that you are a ball of rubber. There are only a few games that I know of which have to do with bouncing at all.

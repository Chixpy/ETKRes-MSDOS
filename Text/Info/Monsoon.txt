Monsoon is a LucasArts style adventure game that takes place on the island Santa Lanchia. On a beautiful day the main character decided to go fishing but once at sea it started to rain and then lightning hit the boat turning it into scrap. Luckily for the hero he and the boat wreckage drifted ashore on the island Santa Lanchia. Santa Lanchia is a Sicilian colony where people who cant behave are sent and they are like one big "familia". To get off the island the hero must get his boat repaired but before anyone will help him he must obtain permission from the islands big boss. This game was written in C++ using Allegro.

You"ve been ambushed by mummies in an ancient Egyptian tomb. Your goal is simple survival - but with no weapons and no means of escape, your only hope is to outsmart them: the burial chamber is littered with pits, and as the mummies keep advancing towards your position, you may maneuver them into these holes if you"re agile enough.

Mummies features a single round of play; for variety, the positions of mummies, pits, and the player are random.  The difficulty level can be tweaked, too: game speed, enemy speed, and minimum/maximum number of enemies and pits are all redefinable.

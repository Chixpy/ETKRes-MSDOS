One of the first backgammon games for the computer, Backgammon from IBM is a solid rendition of the popular board game.Despite its age, Backgammon stands the test of time fairly well, with crisp graphics, decent computer opponent, and the usual assortment of options (hint, take back move, etc.) that are common in later backgammon games. If you like backgammon, this early classic is well worth a look. Recommended!

Harp Vol. I is a remake of Harp: A Fantasy Adventure Book. This version has VGA graphics as opposed to the monochrome Hercules-only mode of the earlier release. The perspective is top-down rather than isometric, with a visual resemblance to Ultima VII. The story-book visual arrangement is gone as well, the playing area occupying the entire screen. Conversations with important characters are now displayed as large portraits superimposed on the screen.

Major locations roughly correspond to that of the original game, to accommodate story progression; however, the actual layout is completely different. For example, the initial area has a sea shore and mountains, but no field paths as in the first version. Some scenes and conversations have been modified or enhanced.

Gameplay-wise, the only notable change is the addition of random turn-based combat. Battle system is very simple and involves pressing a few keys to have Harp cast magic spells on the enemy. There are no experience points, money, equipment, or any other RPG elements in the game.

Similar to the classic CD-Man, A-Pac attempts to update the classic Pac-Man game with new graphics, sound, etc. It does a decent job of recreating the Pac-Man gameplay you remember with enhanced visuals and audio. There are a few different level themes, and the whole package is generally well done, although there really is not a lot new here gameplay-wise. (Check the included A-PAC.DOC file for some humorous "FAQ"s" from the game"s author.)

Friday Night Football is a strategic game of wit.  You and your opponent coach teams of equal ability; clever play selection, overall strategy, and a little luck are the keys to winning.  Plays are selected from the offensive and defensive play charts.  With each play, ball movement is shown on the playing field, a description of the action taking place on the field is provided on the screen, and a complete set of statistics is updated.  Sound affects can be used if desired.

To insure hours and hours of enjoyment playing Friday Night Football, play outcomes are neither fixed nor generated randomly.  Instead a large database has been compiled and stored on disk.  This data base contains information about each of the possible offensive and defensive play combinations.  This insures realistic and non-repetative play outcomes.

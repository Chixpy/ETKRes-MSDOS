From the ad: "Wari might appear simple, but it can be much more complex than it looks.  There is nothing else available quite like Wari.  It"s fun, it"s challenging, and it"s different!  The game is also designed to help you to learn how to play, and play it well. You"ve "beat" the game?  Not until you have beaten The Elephant!  The Giraffe is child"s play; the Lion and Zebra are only average players--the Elephant will consistently beat them by 15 more stones.  To get the Elephant you"ll have to register Wari."

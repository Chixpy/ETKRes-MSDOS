It is half a year after the happenings in Bedlam where Major Kern defeated evil biomechs. Now they are back under the name Biomex and have important facilities under their control. Of course this has the consequence that the player uses Major Kern"s combat robot to kill them all.

Bedlam 2: Absolute Bedlam is an isometric shooter where the player basically explores big levels and shoots everything on his way. The controls are not too complicated: left mouse click to move and right click to fire. When enemies are killed they leave extras behind like ammo, shield energy or money. The money is used to buy upgrades for the combat robot between the 30 missions. 

The missions have varied tasks, e.g. conquering an enemy base, recovering a new engine or rescuing prisoners. Secondary missions are not mandatory to complete the mission but give useful rewards. Later in the game the player controls up to three robots. The missions are divided in four campaigns which increase in difficulty but can be freely chosen.

Chill Manor, the little known sequel to I.M. Meen (also for DOS), centers around an old woman named Ophelia Chill, who is, surprisingly, the wife of I.M. Meen, whose real name is finally revealed as "Ignatius Mortimer Meen". She has taken "The Book of Ages" and, as she states in her intro song, has "torn out all the pages" and is "making little changes on each one". In other words, she is going to literately rewrite history and make her and Ignatius the leaders of the most powerful empire in the world. You must stop her.

Playing as one of four special agent kids, you must roam through the halls of Ophelia"s Manor and find 5 pages of the Book of Ages. After you find them, you shall have to read info from your voucher and fix the pages by replacing the italicised words and replace them with the correct one from your voucher. But watch out. Many enemies and creatures shall try and catch you (deplete your health to 0). If this happens, you won"t die; you"ll never be born...

Gunboat is a 2D action simulation. You take control of a U.S. Gunboat in several conflict zones.

Your Gunboat carries a crew of four men:

- A first-class petty officer who serves as boat captain and pilot
- A gunner\u2019s mate, who controls the forward guns
- An engine man, who takes care of the engines and serves as midship gunner
- A seaman who controls the aft guns


All four men are cross-trained in each other\u2019s tasks \u2026 redundancy becomes crucial if one or two crew members are wounded or dead.

Be careful on the rivers ...!

Anchors aweigh!

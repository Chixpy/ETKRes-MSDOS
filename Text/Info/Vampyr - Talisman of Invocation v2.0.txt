Welcome to Vampyr: The Talisman of Invocation, an adventure game set in the world of Quilinor. Here, the monsters are very nasty, the merchants very stingy, and the citizens are just a bit crazy. You, as an adventurer, must travel throughout this world to save all these creatures from a certain destruction. It might appear to be a typical task on the surface, but be assured, it"s not an easy one.

Created by two high-school students, Vampyr: Talisman of Invocation is a freeware role-playing game heavily influenced by Ultima games. The hero must save the fantasy world of Quilinor from a grave danger. The player travels through Quilinor fighting goblins, giants, zombies, and other assorted monsters while emptying the pockets of innocent civilians, getting treasure from dungeons, and picking locks off castles doors. 

Visually and in terms of basic gameplay, the game is very similar to Ultima V, though with much simpler gameplay mechanics and interaction possibilities. The hero travels over the top-down world map, enters towns marked as icons, and engages in free-movement tile-based combat that occurs on special screens, against enemies who are visible on the map before contact is initiated. Character creation, however, has little to do with Ultima: the player assigns the more traditional AD&D-like attributes to the protagonist, and also chooses skills, which range from combat proficiencies to lockpicking.

Scavenger is a Lode Runner / Jumpman clone which features slick presentation (256 color graphics and smooth animations) but not a lot of features, gameplay-wise. The object is to run around the levels and collect all of the items and then reach the exit. You can dig holes to trap enemies. It does include a built-in level editor and graphics editor, so if you enjoy making your own levels you might want to check it out. 

(Note: This is the full version, the author released it on his own website. Use the SETUP program to remap the keys; by default the numeric keypad is used.)

"Prepare for the worst. Fungal Man is here. Idol of tens of people. You are the intrepid super-hero who has one purpose in life: to destroy the deadly mutant fungal blobs by trapping them in the damper pods. Sounds easy, and sometimes it is. At other times, it"s a real pain in the dorsal fin. FUNGAL MAN is a ""thinking arcade"" game which includes nine scenarios ranging from easy to moderately difficult. You can also design your own scenarios and turn them in for entry in our quarterly contest (winners receive a free copy of our ""Best of Fungal Man Scenarios"" disk). Registered users can distribute their scenarios (no royalty fee) and make millions of dollars (well, a few bucks anyway) by selling them to their family members, close friends, and other FUNGAL MAN addicts. A habit-forming game that will have you designing your own scenarios before you can say, ""Urg, that"s a really nasty looking fungus you"ve got there.""

NEW! Registered users of Fungal man now have the ability to LINK scenarios, so that you can design large, interesting adventure sets which take the form of a single game."

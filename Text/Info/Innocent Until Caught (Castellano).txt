Innocent Until Caught is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.

Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he"s in big trouble. He"s got 20 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.

Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design and interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits), and a looking glass for detecting small items. Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.

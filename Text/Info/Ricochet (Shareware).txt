"Object: to blow up all guns of the opposite color from yours

Game play: Use left and right arrow keys to select angle of fire and press spacebar to shoot.

The missile will bounce off of the left, right, and top walls, and explode when it hits the bottom.

The guns take turns shooting. The order goes from left to right, skipping guns that are dead.

When you get passed the title screen, a question will appear, asking the number of bounces. This is the number of times a shot must bounce off a wall before the missile will become active. If an inactive missile falls to the ground, it will not explode."

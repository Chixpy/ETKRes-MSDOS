Beyond Columns is a clone of the classic Columns game. Gameplay consists of different sets of tiles moving down the screen at an increasing speed. The goal is to get three or more matching tiles in a row upwards/downwards, left/right or diagonal. When they are lined up correctly, they disappear from the screen. Matches with over three tiles get you more points. A screen with high scores and a boss key function have been included. This game was developed by Brad P. Taylor and was followed by a sequel called Fallout.

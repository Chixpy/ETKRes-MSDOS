"Road Rally Trivia is unlike other trivia computer games. While most games are nothing more than a series of ""flash cards"", asking you questions, then outputting a raw score, Road Rally Trivia offers not only intriguing questions, but an enjoyable trip across the United States in Road Rally fashion. Leaving the usual ""text"" mode behind, the game offers VGA color graphics and mouse operation.

Starting at the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, the game takes you across highways and back roads, to deliver you at St. Louis, Missouri, the gateway to the Midwest."

The second game from Simulmondo based on the Italian comics character Dylan Dog, "horror detective", is a first-person view adventure game largely based on Lovecraft"s literary works and their mythology (Cthulhu, the Necronomicon). While you"re called to investigate on the murder of a famous archaeologist, an unprecedented volcano activity is taking place, with the scientists unable to find an explanation. The game is divided in two parts, and is quite different from other Simulmondo productions based on Dylan Dog.

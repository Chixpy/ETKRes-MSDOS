GOOD TO FIRM is a horse racing adventure based on the British flat racing
season. All the big races, including the English Classics, are featured, as
well as group races, handicaps, maidens and sellers.

Starting out with an empty stable with limited facilities, the object is to buy
horses and improve your stable so that you can compete with your rival trainers
in a bid for the championship title.

If you prefer just to gamble, you won"t be disappointed. GOOD TO FIRM has an
enormous selection of 28 different types of bet.

GOOD TO FIRM offers continual seasonal play. If at first you don"t succeed,
there"s always next season, and if you do succeed, a buck says you can"t make it
two in a row!

Udoiana Raunes 2 and 3 are two fun sequels to Udoiana Raunes, a great Indiana Jones fan game created by two German programmers.Subtitled "Special Edition," the second game in this series is more of an "in-joke" game created to make fun of (presumably) professors the authors knew in real life. It is set on campus, and is a rather short game, although some puzzles are quite interesting and require multiple steps to solve. The third game, subtitled "In Search for Indiana Jones IV," is a more full-fledged adventure that puts Dr. Raunes on a quest to find the Indiana Jones 4 movie script, and bring together Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford together to make the long-awaited fourth film in the popular series. The locations include places that movie fans will be familiar with, including Lucas" Skywalker Ranch, Harrison Ford"s home in Wyoming, and many other interesting locales around the globe. 

Both games feature the same icon-based interface from Udoiana Raunes, similar to Lucasarts" classics. You click on the verb, and the object from your inventory or on screen to execute the action. Fun dialogues with well-designed NPCs, nice puzzles, and a great atmosphere make both underdogs worthy of every adventure gamer"s attention. The games are DOS based, but I had no problem running them in Windows XP; DOSBox isn"t necessary. Two thumbs up!

Lexi-Cross is a fun TV game show based on elements from Wheel of Fortune and Scrabble in a humorous futuristic setting. Competing either against other living creatures (humans, aliens) or against robots, you must flip the tiles and use the revealed letters to form the correct words.

With more than 600 challenging puzzles, Lexi-Cross should keep the average game show fan busy for quite a while.

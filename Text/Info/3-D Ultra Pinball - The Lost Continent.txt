The third installment in the 3-D Ultra Pinball series, this game has a dinosaur theme instead of the space and horror motives of the previous games.

Featuring 15 tables, the game appears to be bigger than the previous games, but most of those levels are much smaller than in the previous games. The story, although very short, involves crash landing on an island taken over by a mad scientist, who is turning the inhabitants into dinosaurs.

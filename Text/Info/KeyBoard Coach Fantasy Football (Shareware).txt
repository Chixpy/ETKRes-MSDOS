"Admit it Bunky! Ever since the mental midget in the front office of your favorite NFL team traded that potential Rookie of the Year running back for that broken down defensive tackle, you knew you could do a better job of running the , , (pick one, or insert a team of your own).

In your opinion, the Head Coach of the above team doesn"t know whether it"s raining or Wednesday. For most of last season you watched him play a QB who hit the guy in the other color jersey as often as he hit his own receivers and then tell the coach ""BUT COACH! HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS OPEN!"".

If you were in charge you would bench the clown and play that third year guy who hasn"t had a chance to set foot on the field. Well Bunky, now"s your big chance! Keyboard Coach Fantasy Football puts you in charge of your own team made up of NFL players. You become the Owner, General Manager, Head Coach, and Chief Scout for your own NFL team. It"s up to you to draft the players, make the trades and set the starting lineup and then take on the other guys in your league head to head.

Now it"s your decisions that determine whether your team wins the league championship or is just another cellar dweller. Should you take a chance and draft Montana? Should you trade Sterling Sharpe for Barry Foster? Should you bench Favre? As the head coach of your Keyboard Coach team it"s all up to you."

Rubik"s Cube is a below-average BASICA game distributed only among IPCO members.Due to limitations of the BASIC language and early 1980 hardware, the game amounts to little more than a quirky piece of PC nostalgia. From the MobyGames description: "Rubik"s Cube is a simulation of the popular puzzle game. You are given a cube where each side is broken up into nine sections. Each section has a different color. Your goal is to arrange the cube so that all sections are the same color on each side of the cube by twisting the cube in various directions. The game uses keyboard commands to allow you to select a cube face and twisting direction. You start out with a properly ordered cube; can you scramble the colors and then get them back again?"

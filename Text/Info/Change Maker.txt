In this children"s game, a rabbit named Eddie is collecting change in his piggy bank.  Each round, an amount of money is displayed on the screen.  By moving Eddie under the correct types of coins and jumping up to catch them, the player has to count out exactly the right amount of change.  Despite the elements of moving and jumping, no dexterity or timing is required to play; the player can"t possibly miss a coin, and the challenge is entirely mathematical.

This rudimentary (single-word command) text adventure takes a frequent game convention -- plunder and carnage -- and places it in the domestic setting of an everyday urban centre.  The task before the player is to run rampant on a brief (8-16 minutes) but intense crime wave (specifically, murders and robberies) and escape the city unapprehended by authorities.  The city, however, has a few anti-social tricks of its own, so watch out!

This educational program, included in Big Blue Disk #26, provides several mini-games designed to teach children about change.  "Name That Coin" and "Pick the Coins" simply deal with matching coins and their names.  "Silly Seals" requires the player to choose coins thrown by seals in order to reach a certain total of money.  "The Cycler" involves catching falling coins to help make change for a dollar.  "Refreshments" has the player picking coins to pay for a variety of food items.  "High Diver" asks the player to add up coins and type in their total value; each correct answer sends a diver higher up a ladder to his goal.  All of the games are accompanied by animation and PC speaker music.

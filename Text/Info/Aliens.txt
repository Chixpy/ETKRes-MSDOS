Some time in the near future Earth recieves its first alien encounter. The aliens are friendly share much of their new technology with the human race. Then the aliens began to become hostile. They left Earth in order to unite their alien military forces against us.

Earth is now forced to use this new technology against the aliens in a fight to save our planet and our way of life. Among this technology is the X-12 "MegaCannon". 

You, as the operator of the cannon, must join in this fight by kicking is much alien butt as you can before you kick the bucket. You are armed with only your plasma cannons and your wits. Your cannon features 360 degree rotation and a 90 degree raisable barrel. You start out with 100% shields, but when your shields are gone, so are you. The aliens have some unknown weapon that they like to shoot alot and will probably hit you alot with to. Each hit lowers your shields five percent.

The aliens have battle plans to attack the area where you are stationed five times. If you can ward off five increasingly diffucult waves of attack, you will save many innocent women and children, probably recieve
a metal of honor in the future, and maybe even a hefty cash bonus allowing you to retire when you tour of duty ends. Good Luck. (You"ll need it . . . ?)

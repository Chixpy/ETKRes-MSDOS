Rectangles superimposed on each other in the form of a cross, and they have four things in common, in which the same squares belong to both figures. Before the beginning of the game we have demonstrated the picture, on which colored squares placed in a particular order, and the player is offered, making the manipulation of rectangles, squares to recreate this situation, which is shown on the screen. The task is complicated by the fact that we have available are only two kinds of action - turn the rectangle one position clockwise or counterclockwise. Of course, bear, repaint or separate squares of each other is forbidden. Any hints or domestic help in the game are missing - hope only on themselves. You can always call up to the model to see how close you come to the end.

Little Monk is a light-hearted top-down action game, starring a bald little monk from the Shaolin temple, famous for the Shaolin Kung Fu-like fighting style. Your mission is to restore peace in the land by defeating enemies such as dragons, beetles and snails, in a large number of scrolling backdrops. Many of your enemies are based on creatures from Chinese myths. During your journey, you can pick up power-ups and acquire new weapons as well.

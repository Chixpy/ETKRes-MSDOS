The classic 1992 wargame has been completely revamped with new artwork, new units, new everything! Every single unit, every single plane, every single ship, gun, tank, etc. are accounted for in this game!

Play against the computer or watch computer play both sides. Do hotseat multiplayer, or conduct play by e-mail (PBEM). The choice is yours. A full "recorder" records your moves and computer moves turn-by-turn for later analysis. Full database editor is included. 

Best of all, it is FREE! Download it from the Matrix Games website!

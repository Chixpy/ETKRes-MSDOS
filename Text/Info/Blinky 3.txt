Blinky 3 is an odd game that has for some reason been requested a lot on the DOS Games Discussion Forum. So, here it is. It was created with the old Game Maker utility, and while compared with other Game Maker games its pretty good, the controls are tough to get used to and the sidescrolling gameplay isn"t particularly entertaining. The graphics are alright though. If you"ve been looking for this game, it"s your lucky day! Otherwise, maybe better to stay away. :) (Note: If you happen to have copies of the other Blinky games please let me know.)

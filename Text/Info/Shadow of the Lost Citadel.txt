According to Salsa Shark, Shadow of the Lost Citadel is based on a never-released 1984 Vectrex game named Dark Tower.

The game places you in a medieval forest known as Broodweed, where you must search for treasure, power-ups, and four special keys, as well as explore dungeons and other areas of the forest. Of course, there are obstacles to overcome, such as poisonous fog, plague, and monsters that lurk within the dungeons. Salsa Shark Productions has changed its initial plans for Shadow of the Lost Citadel by making it the first episode in a series of games that take place within the Lost Citadel universe.

Cyberball is a pinball game where four tables are available: Dooke, inspired by underworld devils, Enlightment, with a space travel theme, Air Crash, about modern air combat and Shark Attack, where a treasure is hidden in the bottom of the sea, and guarded by sharks. Unlike other games, where tables follow a common rectangular playfield, in Cyberball they are square with two or more areas. The screen resolution selected affects scrolling: in the lowest "cyberview" mode (320x240), the playfield scrolls up and down, and using the "full view" (1024x768), everything is visible. Other options range from the number of players to tamper with game physics.

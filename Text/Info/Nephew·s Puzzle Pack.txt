Packed inside this ... uh, pack ... are six different puzzle games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Marbles (it"s like the board game "Mastermind" where you have to guess a sequence of colors) and a few others. Each has many different levels of difficulty, and while the package"s graphics are not great, the fact that there are six different games makes it more appealing. A new version was recently released with new features including a level editor for Marbles and variable level selection.

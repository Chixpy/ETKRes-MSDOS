If you enjoyed the original Cyberbox puzzle game, you will probably also enjoy Cyberbox 2. The sequel features the same sort of puzzles that made the original popular. In fact, it features LOTS more puzzles. :) The action involves sliding boxes of different types in order to complete the level"s objectives. The graphics/sounds of course are extremely outdated but for puzzle fans this might still be a fun diversion.

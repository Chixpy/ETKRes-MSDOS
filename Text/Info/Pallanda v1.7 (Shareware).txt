This is a fun game for the "little people", with enough strategy to make it challenging for Dad and Mom.  Prince Pallanda can be included as one of the four players.  The name, Pallanda, comes from "Pal Land" where everyone plays happily together and King Pallanda makes sure everyone plays fair.  Pallanda is designed so even youngsters that aren"t reading yet can learn to play well.

The object is to land in the winner"s circle by moving to the closest color shown on the spinner.  It sounds simple.  However, the nearest matching color is often in the wrong direction and sometimes you must choose between squares that are the same distance away.  There are hidden surprises along the way with pictures you can watch being drawn.  A red wagon with a broken wheel, that makes you spin for a red square, is one you"ll see.  Some will give you an extra turn and others make you skip a turn.  Finding King Pallanda"s castle yields an extra bonus.  The surprises are hidden in new locations at the start of each game.

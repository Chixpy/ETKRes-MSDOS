Clyde"s Revenge (revenge for what, we are uncertain) is a sequel to Clyde"s Adventure. It is a platform game that has you locked in many strange castles, and your only method of escape is to collect the magic stones to free yourself.

Unlike many platform games, Clyde"s Revenge has no enemies to kill and no bosses to beat. Instead, you must solve puzzles, avoid traps, and pull an innumerable number of levers. You will also need to collect life, in case of the odd tumble from a large height or the most unfortunate slip into a pool of lava.

A chess game based on T2, featuring sounds and characters from the movie as pieces. Captures are animated a la Battle Chess, but the battles take place off the board, in futuristic wastelands and similar stages

The game offers several difficulties and play styles to choose from, along with time control, ratings on the USCF scale over different time-frames and other niceties. Oddly enough, there"s no 2D board.

The sequel to USNF, ATF was the first game made by Jane"s Combat Simulations (part of EA).  The game used the same engine as USNF, with updated aircraft shapes and terrain. Every aircraft from USNF was kept, with lots of new planes and some new weapons.  One of the new features was a comprehensive Jane"s research suite on all the game"s aircraft, weapons, vehicles, ships, etc.

There are 2 full campaigns, lots of single missions, an in-game mission creator, and a quick mission creator.  Replay value was further increased by Duosoft"s toolkit, which allowed players to greatly modify the game with custom add-on libraries.  The game focus is on futuristic aircraft and campaigns, with many of the flyable aircraft still in development at the time of the game"s development.  The  addon, NATO Fighters, added new aircraft and a new campaign.

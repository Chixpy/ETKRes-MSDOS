You need to help Roger Rabbit get out of each room he is stuck in so he can capture Baby Herman before Mommy returns home.  You will want to try using everything around Roger.  Make him pull, push, kick, slide, and jump on objects to see if they"ll help him escape. A timer appears on the screen to show how much time Roger has left.

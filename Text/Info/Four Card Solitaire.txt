In this solitaire game, the player has four columns to work with, and each starts with just one card in it.  Whenever two cards on the bottoms of stacks have the same suit, the card with the lowest value can be removed.  At any time, a single card may also be moved from the bottom of any stack to a vacant column or a new set of four cards may be dealt onto the bottoms of the stacks.  The object of the game is to have an ace at the top of every column.

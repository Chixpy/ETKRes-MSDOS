Banatron is a simple 2 or 3 player "snake" type game. (Also similar to "Nibbles"; you can get that game from QBasic.com in the "Action" category. QBasic itself is part of the "Old DOS" package from Microsoft.) Err, anyways, back to Banatron. It"s not really anything special, pretty basic gameplay, but if you want a simple multiplayer snake game (multiple players on the same computer) it may be worth trying out.

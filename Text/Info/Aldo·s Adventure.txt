You are Aldo (who for some reason looks incredibly like Mario of Donkey Kong). Your mission is to successfully reach the upper levels and obtain the treasure chest that lies within. However, beware of the falling barrels (yes, barrels) that inhibit your progress and threaten to "flatten" you into the existing background. Control Aldo by fast moving, jumping and climbing ladders to reach the pot of gold on the top level.

Obscure version of "snake" with the plot and kiberpankovom entourage. The action takes place in 2520, where on earth survived the fall of the meteorite and the spread of radiation in the cities ruled by the terrible gang corporations. Kibergonschiki - young resisters who do not aspire to change the world, but only to leave the most terrible part of it. Your objective in the game - to hold such a racer through a maze of dozens of levels to the unknown future. graphics in the game, unfortunately, is very relative - a motorcycle racer animation you see only in the event of a fall. Common sense: there is a plane with various obstacles (that is a maze that can hardly be called from the second level), there is a particularly marked squares - the beginning and the end of the level. Pressing the motion of the first square red line starts to move, and you need, driving it, to bring the line up to the second square, so it does not hit a wall or obstacle. Despite really high complexity, Cyber \u200b\u200bRiders have a great advantage: each level entirely visible even before the hero"s movement, so you can try to estimate the route in advance. The game is suitable primarily to fans of unusual, original and really requires thinking of options "snake."

Sequel to Trump Castle II introduces 640x480 cartoon graphics instead of real photos, dealer voices, and also allows you to play as female or male player inside Trump Castle - A Casino Resort by the Bay. Multi-player for up to 5 players (human/computer) may be flown at hot-seat or with a modem.

As in previous games, you are allowed to win money in one of the six games - Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, Slots, Poker, and Craps. But now each of game has more variations and editions. For example, Poker has five modes: Texas Hold "Em, 5 Cards Stud, 5 Cards Draw, 7 Card Stud and Poker Slot Machine.

From the very beginning player in 3rd-person perspective mode should explore the Trump Castle filled with different bright characters including Elvis-clone, singers, stewards, etc., find the proper room and stand in front of table or slot machine. The game view is switched either in 1st-person perspective or in above-the-table mode, where the main game process is flown. Player should set bets, play the games, and collect as much money as he or she can.

The number of players, their looks, and modes may be adjusted with Character Editor.

The game may be saved in progress to load it later.

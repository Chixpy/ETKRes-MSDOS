"By the year 2353, the human race has spread across millions of light years through space, colonizing thousands of worlds and forming an empire known as the Terran Collective. Many people live in this society, harvesting from their planets all the metals, plants, and animals that they can.

Unfortunately for many species native to these worlds, non-humans just got in the way of the empire"s plans. Many humans mercilessly exterminated most of these "inferior" races while they plundered the many worlds of the galaxy. Yet a few species survived, those least susceptible to the human threat because of superior physical or mental strength... or by the providence of blind luck.

These races have joined together to rid themselves of the disease which threatens to overwhelm the known universe, and they have put their heads, tentacles, and antennae together to train a force of destruction. This offensive they unleash against the Terran Collective. With it rides all their hopes of convincing their foes that they are a force to be respected - and left in peace."

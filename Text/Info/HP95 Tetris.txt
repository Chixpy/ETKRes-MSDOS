The HP 95LX was one of the first PDAs, rather similar to the better known Atari Portfolio. It had a 40 column, 16 line, 240\u00d7128 LCD screen and ran MS-DOS 3.22. Any text-based HP95LX program could run on a standard PC as well. A graphic program could run with a few modifications. Gilles Kohl included executables for both hardware platforms in the archive of his Tetris clone. That he chose to have it run, with unmodified graphics, in hi-res VGA on the PC gave it an almost surrealistic quality, fitting its quirky gameplay with all kinds of nasty surprises well.

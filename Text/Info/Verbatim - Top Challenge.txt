Verbatim: Top Challenge is an average colllection of 5 "rugged sport" games, created as a promotional title to celebrate Verbatim"s 25th anniversary as one of the world"s largest data storage companies.The games themselves range from mountain biking and rock climbing to the more interesting parachuting, but none of them is good enough to keep your interest for long. If you collect promotional titles or sports games in general, you might find Verbatim fun for the first few minutes before the tedium kicks in. The game is in German, but the games are easy to play, since they are all arcade-oriented. If you can read German, though, you can read a few colorful pages about Verbatim"s history and its range of products.

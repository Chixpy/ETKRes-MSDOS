Janitor Joe is an action platform game. On an automated space station all of the robots have gone crazy, and Joe needs to escape! In order to escape, he needs to collect all of his keys which are located throughout the space station. You control Joe and need to climb and jump around the various platforms to reach all of the keys. On each screen there are several mad robots wandering about which should be avoided (or you lose a life). You also need to make sure you don"t fall too great a distance or run out of oxygen! There are five different difficulty levels available, and also a special hidden room.

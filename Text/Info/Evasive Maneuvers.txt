A more laid-back shooting game, Evasive Maneuvers has you in control of your space ship, plowing through various high-tech themed levels, shooting and dropping bombs on various obstacles. You must continually collect fuel (by destroying fuel canisters) to keep flying, while avoiding or destroying everything else. (Though as the docs note, "Destroying an object can be more deadly than leaving the object alone." Cuz many will explode.) Decent graphics and sounds too.

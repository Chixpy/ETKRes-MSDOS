Made by the Israeli company Makh-Shevet, "Cruel World" is a tribute to the famous game Prince of Persia, having identical gameplay and looking very similarly to the classic platformer. The hero is an innocent citizen who was thrown into a deep dungeon without trial and explanation. Your goal is to escape from your prison. Just like the Prince, the hero must perform a variety of runs and jumps, fight enemies (skeletons and others) in real-time combat, and occasionally solving environmental puzzles.

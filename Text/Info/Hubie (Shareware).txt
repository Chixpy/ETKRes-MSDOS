Hubie is not a well known game, but it probably should be. The game (slickly presented with nice graphics and sound effects) involves action, platforming and puzzle elements. The goal is to get Hubie to the exit of the level. Hubie has many abilities, such as pushing objects, crushing breakable objects, "coptering", blowing and climbing. There"s a good variety to the various levels but since Hubie has so many different abilities, the initial learning curve is high.

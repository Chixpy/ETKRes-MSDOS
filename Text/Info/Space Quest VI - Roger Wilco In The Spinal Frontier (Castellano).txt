Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in Space Quest 5. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets... But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!

Space Quest 6 is the first Space Quest game to be released exclusively on a CD ROM. It features SVGA graphics and voice-overs. The interface is a bit different from the classic Sierra icon-based one: you choose verbs from a menu, a bit like in earlier LucasArts games. Space Quest 6 continues the humorous tradition of the series and is especially inclined towards parody of famous sci-fi movies.

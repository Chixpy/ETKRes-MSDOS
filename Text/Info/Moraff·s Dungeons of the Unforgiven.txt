Dungeons of the Unforgiven is Moraff"s World and Moraff"s Revenge with a story.

There is more dungeon crawling action and slaying of evil garbage cans, Lesdidian warriors, toxic waste barrels etc. The player runs about bashing creatures, taking their worthless Greater American Dollars and trading them in for real money, and in turn buying weapons to slay more and more creatures until reaching the "bosses", shadow creatures.

The game has 5 modules, named Module I to V, but only the first module is playable in the shareware version. There are 8 character races and 100 magic spells.

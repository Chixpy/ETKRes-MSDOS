My game is named Slider 1.01

It is a fast but playable action games for PCs with VGA cards from 8088 to 80486..

It is not too fast on 80486 because of real time assistance...

There is a screen at the begining that describe the control keys, mainly on the numeric pad... The moving of the engine if quite surprising at the begining but is really fun when you master it...

Nether the less, to topic of the game is not new.. destroying everything and high scoring ( The actual world wide high score is around 257 000  (mine is 214 000))

The animation is quite good, there is a multidirectionnal scrolling, you can stop the sound so  that you can play at work!! Have fun and try at least twice, because it is difficult at the begining!

You can play with arrows, but it is really better (and made for) with the numeric keypad

Screens are in obvious french... but there is nothing important to understand, except keys.

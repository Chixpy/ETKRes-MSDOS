Vigilance on Talos V is about Killian Jared, a man who became a mercenary to save his daughter Celeste from an evil race of aliens known as the Xenos. Having learned the location of their main base from an informant, he begins one-man assault to rescue his daughter.

The gameplay is a lot like Nintendo"s Metroid series. The main goal of the game is to explore the base, blasting enemies with a variety of weapons, and finding special upgrades, such as energy tanks to increase your maximum health and the Saturn Ball, whereby Killian rolls into a ball to squeeze through tight spaces.

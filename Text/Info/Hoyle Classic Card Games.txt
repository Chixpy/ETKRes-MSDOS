The fourth (comparatively little-known) installment in Sierra On-Line"s Hoyle series offers a collection of eight popular card games: Bridge, Euchre, Old Maid, Gin Rummy, Hearts, Cribbage, Crazy Eights, and Klondike.

In addition to reading the basic rules for each individual game, players can now access an interface tutorial and a glossary of game-specific terms, as well as customize a range of options.

Hoyle Classic Card Games is apparently the last volume in the series to feature animated characters from other Sierra titles.

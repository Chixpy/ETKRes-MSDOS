In 1834, in the small New England fishing village of Illsmouth, thedistinguished British scientist Lord Boleskine lost his mind. After studyingancient manuscripts of evil repute, he had travelled to this place toobserve the passing of Halley"s comet. What he observed that night, however,turned him into a raving lunatic. Now, 76 years later, Halley"s comet iscoming back, and young astronomer John T. Parker has travelled to Illsmouthto try to uncover the truth in Boleskine"s wild claims, and see the cometfor himself. 

Shadow Of The Comet is a unique horror adventure, inspired bythe terrifying writings of H. P. Lovecraft.

The CD-ROM version of Shadow Of The Comet (released in 1994) has the following extra features:

- Full speech

- Mouse control system

- New intro sequence

- Bonus program: "Visit To The Lovecraft Museum": This program lets you walk around a small museum and examine various artifacts on display, from Lovecraft"s stories. It uses the same control system and presentation as the actual game.

Infogrames also claimed that the CD-ROM version added more characters, puzzles and locations to the game. This is not true. There are two extra people walking round the village (a woman and a child), but you only see them briefly, you can"t talk to them, you never find out anything about them, and they don"t appear after the second day of the game. There are no new puzzles or locations.

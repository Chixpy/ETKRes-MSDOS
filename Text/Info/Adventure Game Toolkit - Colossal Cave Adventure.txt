The Adventure Game Toolkit is software that supports the development of adventure games. It was written in 1987 by David Malmberg. It was a revision on Mark J. Welch"s GAGS (Generic Adventure Game System), which was written in 1985. AGT was produced until 1992, after which time it was released as freeware (the final version is AGT 1.7). AGT was originally built for DOS but has also been compiled for Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, and others. Scorpia of Computer Gaming World called it, "essentially, a sophisticated compiler", noting its lack of an in-game editor.

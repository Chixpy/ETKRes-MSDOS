Gladius is an action/adventure RPG set inside a mountain where you must fight the evil enemy and save the kingdom.

It features a good selection of game characters to choose from (each with various attributes), it is SoundBlaster compatible, and more.

This is an excellent 2D graphic adventure game which can be played under Windows (including Windows XP). It offers a huge range of characters (5 species, 6 occupations, plus a choice of male or female) and you can even change the mix of strength, agility, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, magic, etc by "re-rolling" the computer-set attributes.

The instructions are quite long and involved and, unfortunately, there is no way of printing them out. Expect a slightly longer learning curve than most RPGs but the results should be well worth the effort to learn the game.

Graphics are quite good for a DOS game but are still not as good as most Windows" games.

When unzipping the archive, it should be noted that the game requires about 12MB of space on your hard drive.

Gladius (a Roman short sword) is a fun game and should be popular with anyone who enjoys RPGs.

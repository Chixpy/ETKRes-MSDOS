The pivotal battle of World War 2 is recreated using Impressions" Micro Miniatures wargaming system. You take an overall command of the units by directing them, and can play out the individual battles yourself if you wish. The screen display uses letters to indicate the unit type, with only functional use of graphics and sound throughout.

The gameplay is turn-based, with you selecting each move for your units before activating them and letting the computer do the same. The strategic considerations include the surrounding terrain, whether the enemy forces are fortified and ready for your attack, unit morale, unit fatigue and remaining movement points. At higher difficulty levels your orders may not be followed to the letter, as the more ambitious or arrogant generals attempt their own plans.

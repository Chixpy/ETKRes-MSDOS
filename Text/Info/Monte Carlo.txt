Monte Carlo, also known as "Weddings" and "Double and Quits", is a solitaire card game that is simple and restful, yet challenging and addictive as well. The origin of the name "Monte Carlo" is unknown, but the game belongs to the "matching" family of solitaire games. The game offers a reasonable opportunity for skill, yet winning often depends as much on luck as making the right moves.

Another installment of Spy"s Adventures is set in Europe this time. And as other games in the series, it is an educational adventure game similar to the Carmen Sandiego series of games.

Jewel thief and smuggler extraordinaire, Dr. Xavier Tortion (aka Dr. X), is somewhere in Europe along with numerous jewels he"s stolen. Your job is to find the jewels and locate Dr. X! 

In the game you have to travel to various European countries and their famous locations to search for clues. You may travel only between adjacent countries on the map. Clues will be left behind by friendly agents and indicate where jewels are located. When you will come across an informant, he should be bribed with money or jewels to receive a clue, where Dr. X is. You only have 3 guesses to uncover Dr. X"s hideout until the end of the game. If you are successful in your mission, you are given an efficiency rating; the fewer turns you can locate Dr. X in and the more jewels recovered, the better your score will be.

The game is available for one player, as well as two game modes for multiple players - cooperative "spy network" or "spy against spy". The progress may be saved and restored later. The best scores will be stored in top list.

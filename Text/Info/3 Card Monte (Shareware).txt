Three Card MONTE is a modern street variation of an ancient magician"s trick. In the original game, a player was asked to find the pea hidden under the walnut shell. In this game, the computer shuffles and randomly deals two black cards and a red card. The object is for the player to pick the RED card. A correct pick pays double the amount bid. Each player starts with $100 and may bet from $1 to $5 on each game. Press either L or M or R to select the Left, Middle or Right card. Just like in the real life, the computer dealer is tricky and very tough to beat. Good Luck!

Springer is a chess program for the IBM PC which offers several levels of varying playing strength to challenge the vast majority of human players, as well as an excellent on-screen display of the chess position.  The playing strength of this program is, quite frankly, not quite as good as that of the best commercial programs, though most human players should find it more than adequate in this respect.  In several ways (including playing strength) I believe this program is far superior to all others I have seen released as shareware products or in the public domain.
         
You should have no trouble using the program if you already know how to play chess.  Springer starts out in its normal playing mode, with the board shown on-screen in the format of a standard chess diagram.  Moves are entered by using the "arrow" keys to move an indicator around the chess board and the Enter key to select the piece you want to move and the square you want to move it to.  If you press an invalid key, a help screen/menu will appear, providing brief instructions and allowing single-key access to special functions such as saving/recalling games in disk files.

Apparently - a variant of the game "s Oil Well , but with a certain plot justification. Understand it was not possible, but the point seems to be reduced to what is necessary to save the oil reserves of humanity. general sense, and even the look of the game utterly similar to Oil"s Well : you need to run some kind of "drill" (or pipe?) able to bend, in underground labyrinths in order to pump oil, and thus avoid the various hazards. But if in the Oil"s Well (this is a variant of 1990) The danger of these was not much (insects and bombs mainly, as we know), here - just a nightmare: there are "rotastye" box like Pac-Man "and ( !), and some fun to ride on the tunnels green creatures, and something like ghosts, and lots of rest. And the effect of their impact on the drill and his "drill" is different: some will die from contact with the "drill", but he will destroy the drill, if touch it (so as to Oil"s Well , need to constantly monitor the movement of the creatures in the labyrinths and periodic "delay" drill ago), someone - quite the contrary. Naturally, the time for completion of each level is limited, for the passage have to get all the available oil (extra points can give killing some creatures), and each level is more complicated than the previous. graphics here, as opposed to Oil"s Well , a very dark, and the odd splash the monkey seems to be saying that in this world there was something wrong, so no funny scenes in this game, unlike its predecessor, will not. And, as mentioned above, it is actually terribly difficult (much harder Oil"s Well , which in itself is not a simple thing), and requires just an amazing response. Unfortunately, more to say nothing special, because the game, in fact - just complicating the development of ancient ideas.

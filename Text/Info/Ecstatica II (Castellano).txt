In the original Ecstatica, the hero managed to defeat the recently unleashed Devil and his creatures in the small village of Tirich and rescue Ecstatica, the witch-in-training responsible for the whole mess.

The two of them journey back to the hero"s land only to find that the forces of darkness have brought the fight home.

In his mad quest for power, the evil Archmage has shattered the Elder Sign which governs reality. This has allowed the demons to pass through into this world, slaughtering the people of the surrounding lands or transforming them into brutal killing machines.

Upon discovering this news the hero and Ecstatica promptly find themselves kidnapped by the demons. A mysterious high priestess helps the hero escape and compells him to journey through the demon-infested land to find and re-unite the scattered pieces of the Elder Sign to drive the demons back to their world. However the Elder Sign pieces are guarded by the Archmage"s dark sorcerors and their followers, and the Archmage himself holds the last piece as well as Ecstatica captive.

Ultimate Soccer Manager 2 is the followup of USM and mostly a graphical improvement over the DOS and Amiga AGA versions. Now sporting a 640x480 resolution, all of the offices menus (from where all options are selected) are crisper and some of them were merged together to simplify navigation.

New features include team and individual training, player personality (meaning that a team of talented players can still be unsuccessful if key players are either psychologically weak or flawed), better catering and merchandising options and setting up plays.

The game is packed with both English, French and German leagues, although all run from different executables.

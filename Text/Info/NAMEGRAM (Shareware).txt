"Playing with anagrams has been a popular pastime throughout history. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) was fond of anagrams -- he rearranged politician WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE"s name to spell ""WILD AGITATOR! MEANS WELL"". Vladimir Nabokov used the name ""VIVIAN DARKBLOOM"" for a character in _Lolita_ -- naturally it"s an anagram of his name. Jim Morrison, poet and one-time leader of The Doors, referred to himself as ""MR. MOJO RISIN""". In the movie _Rosemary"s Baby_, an anagram is an important clue -- ""Roman Castevet"" is spelled with the exact same letters as ""Steven Marcato"".

A proper anagram is a series of recognizable words that uses every letter in the original name exactly once. ""HORS BUGGEE"" is _almost_ an anagram for George Bush, but since those words aren"t in the dictionary, NAMEGRAM would never generate it. It _would_ produce ""EH! GRUB"S EGO"" or ""HERE GO BUGS""."

Wing Nuts: Battle in the Sky is an action-oriented flight game set during World War I. The player takes the role of a young pilot whose airplane base is attacked by Germans coming out of nowhere. He has to find the source of these attacks by shooting all German planes he encounters. The story is told through live-action cutscenes. 

The gameplay almost completely consists of flying through the six levels and shooting German airplanes. On two occasions, the player has to use bombs to destroy a balloon and a bridge.

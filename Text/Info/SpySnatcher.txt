Easily one of best Topologika games and my most favorite by far, SpySnatcher is a great spy thriller that casts you as agent 3084, working on a (what else) secret mission for MI7, the British intelligence agency.You have just been summoned to MI7 headquarters, popularly known as "The Zoo", in order to unmask a "mole". The chief of MI7, Sir Arthur Cayley (known to his friends as "Z") is extremely worried, because the plains for the new Sonic Maxeothrodule are believed to have been leaked. They were kept in his office safe, and were there yesterday when he arrived at 9 a.m.; the safe had been disturbed when he checked it in the morning but the plains were still there. Z reckons that it would take at least an hour to remove the plans, copy them, and return them. That"s how much time you have to find out who the mole is and report the results of your investion to Cayley and Superintendent Hardy, who are off to enjoying their drinks at a bar. 

SpySnatcher recalls Infocom"s later Border Zone and Magnetic Scrolls" Corruption in its masterful storytelling, with appropriate spy gadgets and plenty of atmosphere. The writing ranks among Partington"s best, although non-player characters are not as well defined as in Infocom games (a common failing for Topologika).  In contrast to Topologika"s typical "pure puzzle" approach, SpySnatcher emphasizes plot development almost as much as the puzzles, which are some of the most enjoyable for entrepreneur sleuths everywhere. This is definitely a must play for fans of Topologika, and a worthy challenge for expert sleuths. Be warned, though: in common with Topologika games, SpySnatcher is hard-- don"t expect to solve it in a few hours. Recommended!

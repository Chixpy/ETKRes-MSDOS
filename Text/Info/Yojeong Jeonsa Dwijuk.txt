Yojeong Jeonsa Dwijuk tells the tale of a boy nicknamed Dwijuk ("messy"), who miraculously finds himself in the role of a Fairy Knight, entrusted with the protection of innocents from monsters. The game is a side-scrolling platformer with light role-playing elements, similar in concept to some installments of the Wonder Boy series. Much of the game consists of exploring fairly vast stages populated by regular enemies and bosses. A few friendly characters will sell the hero weapons, armor, and items such as keys and potions. The protagonist acquires a basic projectile weapon early in the game, but can find and buy better gear as the game advances.

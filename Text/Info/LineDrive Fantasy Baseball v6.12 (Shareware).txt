"Ever noticed that there are three things the average man figures that he can do better than anyone else? Generally those three things are barbecue a steak, run the company he works for, and manage a baseball team.

The last is the reason for Fantasy Baseball. Fantasy baseball is the game that has swept the national pastime over the last several years. Fantasy Baseball allows a student or college professor, a Chairman of the Board or a steel mill worker not only to manage a professional baseball team, but to ""own"" it.

With your own team made up of real-life major league stars you become owner, general manager, manager and chief talent scout. No longer do you have to agonize over the errors made by those mental midgets that are running your favorite team into the cellar. Now the day to day decisions are yours to make. Do you bench Canseco? Extend Fielder"s contract? Trade Clark for Clemens? When you own the team it"s all up to you.

U.S.A. Today estimates the number of fantasy team owners to be about half a million (and growing!). The fantasy team owner is ridiculously easy to spot. He"s the guy who can"t get to work on time because the paper boy was late again and he ain"t leavin" until he finds out how Stewart pitched last night. He is the guy sitting in the rear of the divorce court watching ESPN"s Sportscenter on his portable TV while his wife is divorcing him for neglect.

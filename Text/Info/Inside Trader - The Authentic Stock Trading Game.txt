The object of Inside Trader is "to make millions of dollars without being apprehended by the [SEC]."  The player starts with $30,000 and makes money playing the fictional stock market, keeping an eye on current events via "the wire service."  It is entirely possible to play the game without using any inside information. (But what"s the fun in that?)

The commands are very simple.  The player either buys or sells stock, pays for information, gets reports, and, if caught, cooperates with the SEC or destroys evidence.  Cooperating means an automatic fine, but he can continue playing.  If he does nothing, there"s a small chance they"ll drop the charges, but if they don"t he"ll pay a higher fine.  If he destroys evidence, there"s a slight better chance of getting off scott-free, but getting caught means jail time and the end of the game.

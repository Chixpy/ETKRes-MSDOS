"There was a time of peace, but it seems so long ago.

The United Alliance, consisting of all the intelligent life in this sector of the galaxy, had enjoyed a prolonged period of peace.

But a menace arises that threatens the way of life for all species.

They are the Xorg.

The Xorg are a cybernetic species that ""absorb"" other cultures into theirs because they believe it makes life better for all.

What or whom they do not absorb, they either destroy or brainwash.

The casualties have been devastating. The Human Confederation is all that remains of the United Aliance

The Confederation is mounting a final assault against the Xorg. As the last surviving captain with battle experience, you must buy us some time.

At your disposal is the newly built Confederate Starfighter STARBLADE undergoing final construction at Earth Spacedock.

The fate of all intelligent life in the galaxy is in your hands. "

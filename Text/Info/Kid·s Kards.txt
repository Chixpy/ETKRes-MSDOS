This game combines four popular children"s card games into one program.  For solitaire fun, it offers Memory Match, the classic "flip the cards and look for matching pairs" challenge.  For play against a computer opponent, it provides Old Maid, Go Fish and Slapjack.  The first two of these barely need explanation, but Slapjack is slightly less well-known.  In it, players take turns laying down cards.  If a Jack is played, the first player to slap it takes the whole pile of cards.  The winner is whichever player manages to collect the whole deck.  Because of the element of reflexes to this game, adjustable difficulty levels are provided to modify the computer"s reaction speed.

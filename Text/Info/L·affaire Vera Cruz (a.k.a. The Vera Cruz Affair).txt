You are Detective Sergeant in the Crime Squad at Saint Etienne (Loire). As an Officer of the Police, you are capable of leading any criminal investigation. As you took your post up, you were called to investigate what the press are fast terming "L"affaire Vera Cruz"(The Vera Cruz Affair).

Prostitute Vera Cruz sprawled on the floor in her "Forest" apartment was found by caretaker. The pool of blood poured from a bullet wound in her chest. It was believed to be a case of suicide with a gun as the weapon involved. But you have to prove that it was a murder.

The gameplay flows in two parts: crime scene investigation to collect the evidence, and work with telex machine to gain information about possible suspects.

At the crime scene, you should collect all possible evidence moving the marker on the screen and examining the objects scattered at the scene as well as the body itself.

With telex machine you should perform investigation according to the police procedures. Different actions are possible here such as sending messages within Diamond Network to receive the replies, printing the notes, contacting other Police services to gain the new information, comparing the evidences, carrying out examinations such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis of suspects, and arresting finally. To specify the subject for each action you should type it.

The first part of the Novels of French detective quest. Your character - a police detective in the French town of Saint-Etienne (Loire department), charged with the disclosure of the most complicated cases. plot of the first part is the following: a prostitute Vera Cruz was found dead with a bullet wound to the chest at his safehouse. Some police officials have already declared the incident a suicide, but the task of the hero is to prove that it was after the murder, opened it. Kind of the game in the first person, and all the game action takes place, in fact, all on one screen ( room with a corpse), where you have to drive a cursor on the screen to explore available there items that may be possible hooks. The game is something of a "telex" in which our hero receives information about possible suspects (located at the bottom of the screen). presence of this same telex, by the way, partly in common with the game "text adventure with graphics," because for the commission of any -then action (request for information, expertise and help from other police, checking alibis of suspects, talk with them, and even the arrest of [all this is happening in this very telex]) the name of the action to be printed. Due to the fact that the game came out only in France and, accordingly, in French, its playability in modern conditions is very small (one must not only possess the written French, but also to be able to somehow enter the letters from the keyboard French alphabet, which are not either in English or in Russian ...). graphics in the game is not entirely conventional, but, to be honest, not too-designed (especially in the PC-version) and very minimalist. To date, the game is almost exclusively historical interest.

The mouse (or trackball) moves your spaceship around, the bottom 1/3 of the screen, so you can only go up part of the way and the left button fires. You can hold it down if you want, we really don"t care.

If you shoot a snake in the middle of its body, it will split into more snakes, just like chopping earthworms in half with a shovel, except they really don"t do that. If you shoot any part of the snake, a tally bar on the right column will climb. Once the tally bar reaches the top of the column, it will turn red and energize your ship. If your ship is energized, you can wait until a snake gets close and nuke lots of body parts by pressing the right button. That part is really cool. If a snake reaches the bottom of the screen, he will become armor plated and require two hits to kill, one for the armor and one to get the snake. The smaller the snake, the faster it goes, so try and shoot them in the head. 

Spiders are really mean, and the more you shoot them, the faster the go. However the spider does resetitself at the end of each level, so if you chow just a little on a level, it will go back to normal speed on the next one. If you kill enough spiders though, you can get a bonus life. Just watch out, because the energized attack doesn"t hurt the spiders.

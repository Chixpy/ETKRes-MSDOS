Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing from Software Toolworks is a revolutionary typing program that spawned many sequels and a host of imitators.4-color CGA graphics doesn"t hamper the game"s appeal at all, as it"s not only adequate, but surprisingly very pleasant: you see all the keys clearly, and there is are "ghost" hands that track your typing in real-time. 

The program is user-friendly at its best: you can choose to skip lesson, play a fun typing game (3D racing), or read the vast amount of well-written on-line help and tutorial. Accuracy, speed, and % completion are shown as real-time meters to the left of the screen. You can even use a ticking metronome to time your key presses. 

With excellent execution, outstanding on-line help, and a plethora of graphs and options to tailor the program to your typing preferences, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is, without question, the best typing tutor ever made, with a design that truly stands the test of time. Perhaps nothing attests to the program"s endurance better than the fact that the series is still going strong (it is now a label of Br\u00f6derbund) even after its original developer The Software Toolworks changed its name to Mindscape and later bought out. Definitely the best keyboard-related product since Dvorak"s keyboard. Two thumbs up!

Westphaser is a very nice Operation Wolf-style shoot"em up by Loriciel set in a Wild West scenario.Gameplay is simple: shoot targets as they appear on screen. Shooting innocents will penalize you, while shooting baddies earn score. Despite very drab CGA palette, the game manages to be quite fun to play, owing to funny antics of the various targets, smooth animations, and many surprises throughout the level. Great fun, especially if you enjoy mindless shooting games. Too bad the great Amiga music is missing in this PC version.

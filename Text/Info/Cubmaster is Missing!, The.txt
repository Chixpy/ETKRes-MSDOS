"Next week you will be promoted to Weblos and receive your badge. You report your regular weekly meeting of Pack 34 at Hanson AA to practice for next week when you discover... THE CUBMASTER IS MISSING!!!!!

Steve Amico is never late for meetings so you know something is up. You phone Steve"s house and his wife says she knows he was there, he called her fifteen minutes ago and told her he heard strange noises. You call the assistant Cubmaster, Glenn Trefethen and he says he knows nothing.

You have been reading lots of ""Hardy Boys"" Mysteries so you decide you are the best man for the job. You go inside the Hanson AA and look around for clues. You might want to go home too before you go too far because something really strange has happened in Hanson and there are monsters everywhere and you need your armor and weapons. You might want to stop at Danny"s house and see if he wants to JOIN you too.

Well, you better get started now, I believe if you don"t find him quickly that something awful will happen.....

Well, what are you waiting for????"

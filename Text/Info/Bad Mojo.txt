Roger was about to do something bad.  Unfortunately, he can"t remember what it was because he has been transformed into a cockroach.  In this Kafkaesque graphic adventure game, Roger (you) must scurry through the walls of a run down San Francisco bar trying to restore his memory and his human form while avoiding spiders, a roach eating cat, and other creatures that live in the bar.

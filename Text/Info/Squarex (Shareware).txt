If you"ve ever wanted to play a strange cross between Pac-Man and Qix, this is the game for you! :) This game involves moving around the playing field in a Pac-Man like manner, but instead of collecting dots, the object is to trace around squares. The game"s graphics are nothing special ... if you like squares, you"ll find plenty of them here. But the game plays well and is tougher than it looks!

Mahjong is played around the world, by various cultures in many forms, with variations in lay and scoring that may differ from house to house.  The precise history of the game is incomplete, but it is clearly a Chinese game, and, since the People"s Republic frowns on all forms of gambling, the most common version today is surely that which is played in Hong Kong, where it is part o daily life as the Star Ferry and won ton noodles.

We have tried, therefore, to fashion this game in the Hong Kong mode, using tile images copies from the plastic sets one would find in the typical Kowloon household, adhering to locally accepted rules.

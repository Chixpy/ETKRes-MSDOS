"KRYPTO is a computer game which encourages creativity and thinking. If you like to be challenged intellectually or like to challenge others then this game is for you!

The program is in two parts. You can solve Kryptograms or you can create them for others to solve. Since there is no challenge in solving puzzles you have created yourself, share them with others - your spouse, children, friends, colleagues or the world at large. Just give them a copy of KRYPTO and the Kryptogram files you have created, and let them have fun meeting your challenge."

A few monthes a go ago you discoverd how to open gates into other  dimensions. It was through using a device modified from your television remote control. One day you built up enough nerve to test the device, hoping it would take you to a place filled with riches beyond your wildest dreams. It took you to a world of riches alright, but you did"nt count on ending up in a dark world consisting of strange walls and traps either!

So far you have no idea how long you"ve been trapped in this dark world, but you know it"s been a long time. You are tired for you can never stop running, the place has a strange curse. Every time you push that little button thats supposed to take you home the device explodes, teleporting to yet another twisted realm of the same dimension. You cannot stop to rest ever, for the curse drives you mad, compelling you to continue on.

You realize now you must spend your eternity running tiredly collecting the pieces to that rediculous device, hoping one day you"ll push the button and be back in your own dimension thinking this was all just a bad dream....

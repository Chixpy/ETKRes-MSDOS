This game demo was created using the PIE Game Creation System (GCS). 5 levels of Blake Stone-like 3D action. You have various objects and weapons to choose from throughout the levels.This version is NOT complete, but is fully playable. The task is simple....get through all 5 levels alive! A save/load feature has been added, but you should have little or no problem getting by without this.

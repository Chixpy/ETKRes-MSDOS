Two curious "interactive novels" from Infogrames that are long on story but short on gameplay, Passengers on the Wind 1 and 2 are romance stories set in the high-romantic era of the 18th century, similar to Infocom"s Plundered Hearts.

Based on a popular French comic strip of the same name, the game"s premise is intriguing: in the first game, the adventure takes place on the eve of the French Revolution, in the troubled district of the Triangular Commerce, that is the slave trade between the shores of Brittany, America and Africa. Hoel, Breton sailor for his country, flees France when unjustly accused of murder. He is accompanied bv Isa, an adventuress who turns out to be a countess whose title has been usurped. With your help, Hoel might regain his honour and Isa her title. Gameplay is limited to only choosing the decision of either Isa or Hoel when their "thoughts" appear on the screen. Although the game is very non-linear, this gives a good illusion of freedom as different choices may lead to different outcome (although they all converge sooner or later). In this sense, Passengers on the Wind games are more akin to Infocom"s Infocomic titles than a "game," but at least the involving storyline will hold your interest to the end. 

Recommended for anyone who likes a good, evolving story (although not necessarily a good writing) or a fan of choose-your-own-adventure books. Anyone looking for a good challenge or a real *game* is well advised to pass these underdogs by.

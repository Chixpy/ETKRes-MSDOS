A mathematical game with a twist: you are given a four by four equation lattice with the symbols and numbers missing.  Your job is to fill in the squares so that all the equations across and down are correct.  You have a set of numbers and symbols at the bottom of the screen that you can choose from and as you use them they disappear from the bottom of the screen and appear in the boxes you assign them.

The Apple II version of this game has hi-res graphics.  The PC version of this game was John Romero"s first PC game ever and was written in Pascal while the game display was done in colored text mode.

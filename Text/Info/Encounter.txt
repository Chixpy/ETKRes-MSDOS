Somewhat similar to Space Invaders, you pilot a craft that is flying through space while avoiding pieces of your destroyed planet and being shot by the alien space craft who destroyed your planet.  You must destroy those craft before running out of fuel.  Rather than a full screen of enemies to destroy, you start out the game only needing to fight two spaceships... but that is just the beginning.

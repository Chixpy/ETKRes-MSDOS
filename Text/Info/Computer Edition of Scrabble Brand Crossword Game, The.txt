Perhaps the earliest "official" version of Scrabble for the PC.  This adaptation of the classic word puzzle game allows up to four players with the option of using computer opponents that can compete at 8 different skill levels.  The 20,000 word dictionary can be amended by the player to include words not initially recognized by the computer.  Other features include a time clock and an option to save and load games.

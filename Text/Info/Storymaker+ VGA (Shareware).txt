Storymaker allows kids (or whoever) to make their own storybooks. It includes a scenery editor (a decent paint program), shape (sprite) editor, melody maker (music composition tool) and a basic text editor. By combining these elements computer storybooks can be created. However it would be a lot of work to create good-looking storybooks like the example, so whoever is using it will need plenty of patience and probably some artistic skill too! (To get the EGA version of the program and some extra tools & info about it, visit this site.)

One of Infocom"s best introductory-level text adventures, Seastalker is a fun undersea adventure that will delight fans of Wishbringer and anyone new to the interactive fiction genre.Matthew Murray"s brief review of the game highlights this underdog quite well: "Because Seastalker was designed primarily for children and those inexperienced with Infocom"s interactive fiction, it tells a much lighter and less complicated story than that of Infidel, Infocom"s previous Tale of Adventure. Due to this, Seastalker was very easy, and made even easier by the hints worked into the context of the game and the hint cards included. However, beyond the generally simplistic puzzles and somewhat linear design, Seastalker did tell a good story about underwater exploration and sea monsters, with two or three somewhat interesting subplots and plot twists, which are to author Stu Galley"s credit. Seastalker is, overall, a good game, and will definitely appeal to children and those who enjoy adventure stories." 

Definitely a good choice for IF beginners and anyone new to Infocom games who doesn"t want to plunge into challenging games (such as Trinity) right away.

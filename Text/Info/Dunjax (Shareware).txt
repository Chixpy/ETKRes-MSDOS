In Dunjax, you are an astral explorer whose ship has crashed on an uncharted planet! After awakening from unconsciousness, you have found your ship pillaged by strange lifeforms. Chiefly missing is a propulsion device that powers the engines of your ship. Donning your gravity boots and ion rifle, you have tracked the beings to a cave set into a nearby mountain range. You must retrieve your stolen part from these fiends to get off the planet and report your discovery to others!

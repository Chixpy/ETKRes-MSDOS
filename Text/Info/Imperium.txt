A very complex futuristic strategy game about galactic domination and a very special anagathic drug.You have been elected as the leader of Earth"s galactic empire and are now in control of the empire"s economy, diplomacy and all military actions. The game uses an easy-to-use window system, albeit a bit spartanic looking. As I said, it"s very complex, but once you got into it, it"s quite an enjoyable game with some nice aspects such as the life-extending drug called Nostrum. Recommended for die-hard strategy fans out there, and expecially fans of Rainbird"s UMS games. The game will likely prove too dry and complex for casual gamers. Don"t forget to also download the manual!

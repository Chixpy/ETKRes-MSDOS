CRYPT takes you to an old church in the English countryside. 

Using the same basic rules and procedures as the famous Colossal Cave Adventure by Crowther and Woods, you will explore the church, its quaint churchyard, then plunge into 
the dark, dreaded chambers below. In the crypt may be found long lost historical artifacts of great value, protected by a host of traps, tricks, and creatures both natural and 
supernatural. The successful adventurer must possess courage, skill, intelligence, and a bit of luck. For the faint of heart or weak of knee, a SAVE and RESTORE feature is provided and highly recommended.

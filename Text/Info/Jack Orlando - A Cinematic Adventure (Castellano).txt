Jack Orlando: A Cinematic Adventure is a classical graphical adventure game, similar to those created by  LucasArts and  Sierra. In this point-and-click adventure the player moves the protagonist figure through a (mostly hand-painted) world, talking to many other persons and advancing in the storyline by solving many different puzzles.

The game"s graphics consist of hand-painted backdrops with cartoon-like character models. All of the dialogue is played as voice-over as well as displayed as text and uses Dolby Surround techniques. The music was composed by Harold Faltermeyer.

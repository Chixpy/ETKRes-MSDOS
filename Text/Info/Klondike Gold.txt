"Klondike Gold is classic Klondike solitaire with a unique twist. In addition to casual play, you can compete with others through the magic of ""duplicate MatchPlay"" (more on that later).

At the start, you"ll be asked to sign in with a unique ""handle"" or ""alias""(Texas Slim?). Later, you"ll have a chance to change your mind before receiving your first MatchGame. At no other time need you touch the keyboard as everything is done with your mouse. Only the left button works and double clicking is never required. You"ll find it easy to pick up cards (just click down), move them (move the mouse) and drop them (release the button). You can"t make an illegal move so don"t worry about accidents.

Obviously, you can play whenever you please for as long as you wish. There are many features to be enjoyed without it costing you a penny. When you feel your game is good enough to challenge others, ""Klondike Central"" will provide you with a ""seat at the table"" to test your mettle. Just how Klondike Gold can be both a solitary game AND a competitive event is explained in the ""Klondike Inplay Help"" and ""MatchPlay Rules"" files (click on ""Help"" when you exit from here)."

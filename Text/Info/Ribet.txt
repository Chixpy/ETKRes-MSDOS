Munch, Invaders, Sanction and Ribet are four simple arcade games included in COSMI"s Top Ten Solid Gold compilation.The only thing these four games in common is the fact that each game is a rip-off of well-known games from ATARI and Midway - only with different names (to make them harder to guess for a casual gamer who bought this pack expecting 10 original games, one would think). But you will be able to recognize the games as soon as the intro screen comes up: Munch is just Pac-Man, Invaders is your basic defend-the-bases game, Sanction is just a strange name for Robotron: 2084, and Ribet is just Frogger. These games are quite addictive - after all, they are nothing but renamed versions of some of the world"s most successful arcade classics. Recommended, but only if you cannot find the original games, or are curious about this early incident of plagiarism in game publishing history.

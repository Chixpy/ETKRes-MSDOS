The object of MasterMind is to guess a hidden combination of colors that the program will choose. Upon entering your guess you will be told the number of colors in your guess that fit colors in the hidden combination in the exact place. You will also be told the number of colors in your guess that are in the hidden combination but on different places. In choose the hidden combination the program cannot use a color more than once.

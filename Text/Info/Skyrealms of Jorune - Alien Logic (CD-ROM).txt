In one of the most unique RPGs ever, you must discover the secrets of the Warpworld to defeat the evil Red Shantha and rescue your fellow villagers.

Despite it being based on a good paper and pencil RPG, the game is more akin to an action/adventure game than traditional RPG due to its lack of character stats and focus on puzzles and conversation with NPCs, and combat relies more on reflexes than planning. Still, the intriguing alien world and neat spells make up for its quirks. Just be prepared for some serious bugs, some repetitive combats, and a lot of time spent on travelling.

Collect the fruit, avoid the snakes and creatures and try not to fall in any pitfalls in Kid. Stephen Vogler"s straightforward platform game let"s you play as the titular "Kid" and advance through a handful of levels while trying to survive the usual foes. Plan your path well because those blocks you keep busting with your head could lead to a safer path and an exit worth more points. You have three lives and no continues after a game over scenario but you will pick up exactly where you left off after each lost life. Getting hit once by enemies will do you in. A high score table is displayed at the end but you must score higher than 1000 points to end up on it.

Tetris is a game where you have to manipulate (moverotate) shapes consisting of blocks and build rows out of them. When you fill a full (from one edge to the other of the playing field) horizontal row that row gets cleared and all the rows above it drop down one place. If the rows reach the top of the screen the game is over. The goal is to clear as many rows as possible before the game ends.

Probably one of the most pirated games in computer history (right up there with California Dreams" Blockout), Stargoose is a cute little top-down shooter starring you as *cough* a futuristic goose.Aside from the usual assortment of enemy ships and ground-based defenses to shoot at, Stargoose features several neat ideas. In addition to shooting the baddies with your pea-shooter guns and your missiles, you must collect the 6 multicolored crystals to advance to the next stage. The bonus runs are not played from the top-down view but in 3D tunnels. These tunnels are the only places you can pick up new weapons and shields, without the nuisance of enemies. Overall, Stargoose provides good ol" fashioned shooter fun that should keep newbies happy, although veterans will find it too easy, too short, and a bit repetitive. The game is also notable for being one of the first 256-color VGA games ever made.

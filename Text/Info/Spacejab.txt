This fanmade space shooting game definitely has the look and feel of an early QuickBasic project (those of you who learned to program in Basic as your first language will know that I mean!) but its also obvious that a lot of work went into this game. Variable difficulty (with plenty of tips in the training mode), several types of aliens to fight and other nice touches help add to this game"s overall feel. However, the gameplay itself is not too exciting or deep, and usually doesn"t last very long.

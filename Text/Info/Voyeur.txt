This person hires a private investigator, who will have to discover the secrets of the family in order to obtain a definite proof of Reed Hawke"s crimes.

Voyeur is an interactive movie with live action cutscenes, somewhat similar in format to the full-motion video game  Night Trap. The gameplay consists of controlling various cameras located in the Hawke family estate, spying on its inhabitants and hence triggering the next movie and advancing the storyline. A unique feature of the game is the random nature of the informant within the Hawke family; his/her identity changes with every new game, which influences the subsequent narrative.

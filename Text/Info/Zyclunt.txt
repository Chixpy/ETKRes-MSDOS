Zyclunt, alternately titled Blade Warrior, is a very fun side scrolling platform game that features some very cool anime graphics. It was distributed only in shareware channels, which tended to detract from its mainstream popularity. It is a futuristic title and was published by Image Works. It was released for play in the fall of 1991.

It appears to be a medieval setting, filled with fun fantasy and adventure, but really it is set in a dystopian future in the year 2002 A.

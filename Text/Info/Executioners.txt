Remember, in 1992, when you played the ugliest side scrolling fighter you"d ever seen? Well, it"s still here, and damn is it still ugly. Cannibal Ed has poisoned the population with his Atomic Food Products, and it"s up to our boys to kick his Cajun buttocks back to Nawlens. Reaper is the ugly little brown pajama wearing psycho with exacto knives laced into his arms and legs. Guillotine is the poorly drawn large ape with a skull for a head and an IQ almost as low as the Backstreet Boys combined. The two will fight their way through the endless swarms of mutants with axes and machine guns, replenishing their health with those little midget-headed tuna (who needs to replenish health anyway? Doesn"t this game have endless continues? Go figure). Featuring such exotic locales as Breakneck Cave and The Nationwide Midget Emporium, and a slew of whacked characters like Roadkill, the living auto disaster, or Mr. Mojo the human tourist trap/grass skirt wearing voodoo lord. So...the game is sadly lacking in all forms of beauty, it"s still fun and you"ll get a good laugh.

Action soccer is a quick and uncomplicated soccer game with two different graphic styles (2D overview and 3D isometric). The 16 teams have 6 skills like speed, strength, shotpower etc.. There are no things like offside, fatigue or tactic. You can play a friendly game, the UBI-Cup, a championship or a tournament. In few options you can change the weather (sun, night, rain, snow) or little tactic (offense, defense, normal). Worth mentioning is also the funny audio-commentary from Jonathan Pearce and the editor.

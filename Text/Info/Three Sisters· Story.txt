You once lived in a happy and somewhat rich family... you were only a boy when your father decided to stop the running train by himself. Your mother died out of cancer, and you got separated from your older brother. Ten years have passed since that moment, and one day, your brother came in a $250.000 worthy car, telling you he knows who"s responsible for your father"s death. It was Shoji Okamura.

Your brother plans to destroy Okamura family entirely, and you"re glad he included you in that dangerous game, as you also like to see the man responsible for destroying your family either ruined or dead, so your brother financed your schoolarship, bought a house just next door to Okamura"s, and you two started the game of seduce and destroy. It appears that Shoji Okamura has three daughters, most likely, not aware of what their father is alike. You got your place inside that family as time went by, and you were considered as the closest friend... but you knew who you actually were.

One day, Shoji ran away, abandoning the house along with his daughters. The eldest one, she had to leave college and get a job in order to support her sisters, and whole family was beginning to sink deeper and deeper in their debts. But your brother seems to be interested in ruining not only Shoji, but his daughters as well. The only problem is, you"ve fallen in love with these sisters. And now, you seem to be the only one able to stand between your long-lost family, your brother, or the woman you love, Emi.

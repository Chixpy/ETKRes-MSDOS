Qb-Wormy is probably one of the better Qbasic "Wormy" clones out there.

It is reminiscent of such games as Nokia"s Snake, Rattler Race, Nibbles, and of course, the game it is based on, Wormy. Wormy was a game made for the Apple IIe"s, and the object was to run around the screen and collect blinking boxes, all the while growing longer. Back in grade school, I played Wormy constantly; it was my first game, my favourite game. So here is my build on it. I started this game around Dec 13th, but school and work have kept me from it, so it took longer to finish. Besides, I spent more time playing the game than developing it :) I have written a very poor Wormy v1 as my first game ever, that may be floating around the net somewhere... but it is not as good as this one.

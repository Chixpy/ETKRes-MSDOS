Despite the title, Wild Learning Safari doesn"t really let kids "learn" anything about wildlife, but is simply an interactive coloring book -- although an attractive one with many options.Kids can choose from a variety of animal scenes, then color the picture using the colors provided. Animals can be animated, and the whole picture can be colored automatically by the computer (using reasonable colors such as green for trees, blue for the sky, etc.) if your little artist is too lazy or impatient ;) Dozens of backgrounds are available, as well as individual plants and animals kids can add as "stickers" onto the scene. For a finishing touch, word balloons can be added with any words on the screen. The scene can be saved for later or printed out on paper. Overall, it"s nothing more than a coloring book, but a pleasant one that offers a good variety of scenes and excellent VGA graphics. Budding artists in your house will probably enjoy this unassuming little program. Thumbs up!

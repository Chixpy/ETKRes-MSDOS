The mighty god Odin goes from time into deep sleep. During the time of such an "Odinsleep", the mischievous god Loki stole from Odin his favorite land, Midgard, and populated it by monsters. But Odin has a son - Thor, the god of thunder. Using his powerful hammer Mjolnir, Thor must travel to Midgard, face Loki and his assistants, and reclaim the land for his father.

God of Thunder is an action game with strong elements of puzzle-solving. Thor explores Midgard, fighting enemies in action-based combat, using his hammer or lightning attacks. Many hazards are there to make the hero"s life difficult, and the player must solve puzzles to protect Thor and advance the story. The puzzles range from simple exercises in re-arranging objects to more complex examples that occupy the entire screen. Most of the game is viewed from a top-down perspective, though there are platform sequences as well.

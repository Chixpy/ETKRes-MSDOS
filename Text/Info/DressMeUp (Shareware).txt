"DressMeUp is an imaginative paper doll game with a cute collection of animals to dress up. A girl and a boy may be picked from any of the four different animals on the shelf to play with. There are blouses, skirts, slacks, hose, purses, jackets, shoes, hats, coats, shirts, sweaters, pants, and socks hidden behind the cabinet doors to choose from.

DressMeUp comes with two complete outfits for the girl and boy animals and eight more outfits can be added to their wardrobes. Provisions are available to replace any of the items in any of the ten outfits with new items of clothing to provide a constant variety.

In addition to all of the different outfits, a Water Color box will appear on the screen and let you paint the clothes or the animals themselves. The paint box includes polka dots, stripes, and a wild plaid."

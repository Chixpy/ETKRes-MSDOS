Fill up the tank, buff the bodywork to a chromium shine and hear that V12 purrr like a kitten. It"s time once again for the SHOTGUN RUN - an illegal race across several demanding courses, where every twist and turn of the track will test your nerve, not to mention suspension! Through the sun-kissed beaches of Bluewater, floor-it past the ancient castle ruins with barely a moment to admire the scenery before screaming through the streets of St. George, after sundown. Head south past the sub-tropical lagoons, whilst trying to keep your supercar from becoming a permanent fixture of the landscape! Only the hardened drivers continue past this point, ascending the dangerous road through the Azure Falls, where the sane finish at Bow Bridge. Only the insane and the fearless head onward to the wild, blizzard-lashed mountains for the final, ultimate prize.

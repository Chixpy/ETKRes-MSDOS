This is a digital conversion of an amusement park/carnival game with a twist, released by the School of Telecommunications Engineering of Barcelona as a stress-relief tool. The player controls a student armed with eggs and tomatoes, and now it"s time to get back at the teachers for the pain they caused!

The aim is to complete five courses by venting your frustrations at cartoon renditions of the school staff.  Moving wooden boards will flip around to reveal your targets - try to clobber the teachers (numbered targets) and secretaries.  Aim quickly: miss three teachers in a row and it"s game over.  Study accessories are worth extra points, but be careful and don"t hit other students, or the janitor - or (worst of all) the game"s programmers.

Another planet, another crash landing. Sadly this time it"s quite hostile due to being a security hive. To make matters worse you"re without beer. Your only hope of rescue is to telepathically control your somewhat dimwitted clones and send them out on a rocket ship off the planet. Once off the planet they just might be able to get someone to come back and rescue you.

Controlling the clones is somewhat simple since your link machine has been a bit on the damaged side after the crash. Give them two word directions and they"ll do your bidding. Sometimes they might not understand what you say so maybe you might need to re-word it. You can give them walking directions with simply typing N for North, D for Down, etc. On top of this you can give them directions for interaction such as "Open Door" or "Take Berries" etc. With these simple directions you must guide a clone to enter the security nest, activate the ancient rocket ship  and blast off of the planet. If they fail to do so you can forget about ever having beer again.

Another Lifeless Planet and Me With No Beer is a text adventure game set on a distant planet with limited ASCII graphics used to illustrate alien life-forms, objects and other special items you run into. The goal of the game is to get rescued off the planet with the risk of death being only a small typo away.

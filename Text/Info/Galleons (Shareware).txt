"GALLEONS is a naval combat simulation in which two people may fight head to head or one person may fight against a computer player, or two computer players may even fight each other if you so desire.

Game Play is fairly straight forward. Try to sink the other player without getting sunk. You can do this by either ramming or firing cannons. To fire cannons hold down the fire button until your range bar gets to the desired range, then release. You may also raise or lower sails to control your speed. Remember, wind will also affect how fast you will go in a given direction. You may also turn right or left as long as your rudder stays intact. In other words, don"t get hit from behind. Controls are changed in the controls menu and ships status can be changed in the game options menu. Your score is based on relative strengths of ships plus points scored for cannon hits."

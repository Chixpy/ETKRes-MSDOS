The objective of Rampcube is quite simple.  You are trying to arrange colored cubes in a certain way to score points.  When the game starts, colored tiles will start coming down then ramp.  At the bottom of the first ramp is as grey catcher.  You move this back and forth with your arrow keys.  If you catch the tile at the end of the first ramp, the catcher will immediately place itself on top of the next chute.  The catcher will turn the color of the tile you caught.  Now that the catcher is located on top of the bottom ramp which is a 10 x 10 grid. You can move the catcher to place the tile in the column you want.  You only have 2 seconds to do this, or else the tile will drop wherever your catcher happens to be.

The idea is to create squares called Cubes, out of 4 separate tiles.   A cube is defined as 4 tiles of the same color making a box.  There are Blue,Red,Green,Purple and Yellow tiles.

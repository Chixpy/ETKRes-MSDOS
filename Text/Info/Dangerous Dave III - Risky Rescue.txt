Dangerous Dave is back in this gory and macabre adventure! Battle wolves and other man-killing creatures with your shotgun attempting to rescue Dave"s little brother Delbert from the castle of the evil Dr. Nemesis. There are 11 levels in the game and some more creatures than in the previous installment. This was considered a very gory game for its time.

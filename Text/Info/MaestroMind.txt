"Well, I kinda don"t know where you"ve been in the last decade if you haven"t ever seen this game. But anyway, for those who were born yesterday, here are the basic rules of the game:

Every player (in this case, the computer and you) chooses a number. No two digits in the number can be identical. Certain other restrictions may be optionally allowed. The purpose of the game is two guess the other player"s number before he guesses yours. This is done as follows. The players take turns guessing numbers. For each guess you make, the computer gives a score based on its similarity to the computer"s chosen number: one black point for every digit which is in its right place, and one white point for every number which exists in the computer"s chosen number, but in a different location. For instance, if the computer chose the number 0832, and your guess is 2813, you will receive one black point (for the 8, which is in the right place), and two white points (for the 2 and 3, both of which exist in the computer"s number, but neither of which is in the right place).

While you are guessing the computer"s number, the computer is also trying to guess your number in the same way. The computer makes guesses and you must tell him how many black and white points it got. The first one to guess the other"s number is the winner."

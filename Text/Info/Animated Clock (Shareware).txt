Animated Clock is a program for children from pre-school through third grade that teaches them to tell time in a variety of ways. This life skill program helps them convert digital time to analog time and vice-versa. Difficulty levels can be selected to provide practice in increments of hours, half-hours, 15 minutes, 5 minutes and one minute. Animated rewards pop out of the cuckoo clock"s doors for each correct answer, and 10 correct answers are rewarded with a full-screen silly animation. Graphic help is given as needed to help the student learn the skills. Keyboard and mouse support are provided!

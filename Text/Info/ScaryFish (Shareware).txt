"ScaryFish Version 2 is an exciting multi-species fishing game for 1-4 players. The game is extremely realistic except for the lack of mosquitoes, jet skis, pollution, overfishing, or looney activists. Anglers will appreciate the realism, but you can enjoy the game even if you never fish in real life. The game simulates the excitement of exploring a world filled with fishing holes, choosing presentations, casting, anticipating the bite or strike of a fish, and fighting fish once they are hooked. The game has a variety of options for where you fish, mode of play, and presentation including rod and reel, line, bait/lures, and accessories. The multi-species aspect of the game makes it extremely exciting and suspenseful; you never know what species will bite your line next. You might be innocently fishing for Bluegill or Crappie when suddenly... a huge Catfish or Gar runs off with your line! Or you might be fishing for Bass, fighting what you think is a trophy Largemouth, but when you land the fish it turns out to be a Carp! As you play the game a number of humorous mishaps might occur such as tipping the boat or catching something that isn"t even a fish!

You can run this game over and over without mastering it or getting tired of it. The results will be different every time you play since as in real life, luck is a factor along with skill, strategy, patience, and reflexes."

Vegas Bandit is a decent slot machine simulation.The game is very simple: you start the game with 100 coins, and can bet 1 to 3 coins each time. After betting, click on the handle to pull it down, and the results will show up on the screen. Once you run out of coins, you can start a new game. That"s about all there is to the game. Compared to games like Arcade Fruit Machine, Vegas Bandit pales by comparison in terms of graphics and play options. Well, at least it does look very similar to what Las Vegas slots actually look like :)

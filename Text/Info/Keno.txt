Keno is a simple, no frills adaptation of the popular casino game. You must pick up to fifteen numbers out of eighty total. Once you"ve done that, the computer will choose twenty random numbers.

If any of the numbers you chose are the same as the ones that came up during the random drawing, you win a prize. If you pick more numbers, the maximum prize will also increase - but it"ll also be harder to win the minimum $1 payout.

Popcorn is a  Breakout-style game. Your goal is to destroy bricks with a ball that bounces off a paddle you control. The layout of the bricks is different in each level. Some bricks are indestructible, forming areas that can "trap" your ball or force it to bounce off in a sharp movement, making it more difficult to hit it with your paddle. Other bricks take several hits to break. There are also enemies which float around the bricks and will deliberately bounce off your ball and disturb you. You have a certain amount of "lives"; each time you let the ball fall down the screen, you lose a life.

There is a variety of upgrades (letters that fall down when you break certain bricks) to use in this game. Those upgrades are:

Your paddle becomes longer
Your paddle can shoot lasers at bricks and enemies
The ball is glued to your paddle whenever it falls on it
Three balls appear instead of one
You gain an extra life
The speed of the ball decreases
All the enemies stop their movement
A floor appears that prevents your ball from falling
Your ball is sent into the opposite direction
You are immediately transported to the next level

An editor is included which allows you to create your own levels.

It"s been almost ten years since the end of the last great pong war. Earth has fallen on hard times as ruthless leaders squander the last fuel and food sources. Some corporate giants offered to share their resources, but others were only interested in getting more. So the wars started again. This time it wasn"t five sentient being battling for dominance; it was humans killing humans in a desperate race for life. You have been chosen by your corporation to lead them into the tournament. The ultimate tournament to settle the score. Good luck, Captain.

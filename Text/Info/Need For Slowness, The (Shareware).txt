This game is quite simple. Steer your car along the winding road. This road gets narrower the further along you go, Not much of a problem, But with four difficulty levels, Easy, Medium, Hard and Suicide you can vary the starting width of the road. See how long you can last without crashing into the crash barrier. Like most games, you have a limited number of "lives" or in this case - Replacement cars, allowing you to crash five times before the "Game-Over" screen.

The laws of nature have been broken in the town of Reality-on-the-Norm: a dead person has been brought back to life as a zombie. You are Death, the Grim Reaper, who is ordered to come to Reality and return the zombie to being dead. 

The game is controlled with a mouse; similarly to Sam & Max Hit The Road, right-clicking changes the cursor action (Walk to, Look at, Interact with, Talk to), while moving the cursor to the top of the screen makes a menu appear, allowing you to easily change the cursor actions, access one"s inventory or save/load/quit the game.

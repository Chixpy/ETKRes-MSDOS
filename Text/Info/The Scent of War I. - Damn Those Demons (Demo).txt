This is a demo copy of Scent of War I - Damn those Demons. It is not the actual game and is lacking almost everything. It will allow you to play three different dungeons and fight a few different monsters. You can try out a couple aspects of the game. Only three character races are included in this version, and only four different monsters. You may view your character by pressing I on the map screen. Have fun, and remember that this is only a VERY small portion of the game.

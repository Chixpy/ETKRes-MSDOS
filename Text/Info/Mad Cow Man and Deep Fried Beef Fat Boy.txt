"There"s a current state of emergency that threatens everything British... it will prove more trying and more vital than the time we had to stop Playboy from publishing the Queen Mum pictures -- the Crown Jewels have been stolen!"

Sounds kind of like the beginning of an exciting text game adventure, doesn"t it? Well, as it turns out... it"s actually the end of one. (Well, of the first installment of one... going on almost nine years now with no hint of the next episode 8)

In this installment (#40) of the Blender competition, participants were urged to submit works engaging the themes of "Superhero", "robbery" and "England". While Captain Britain is nice for traditionalists, the authors here have selected Mad Cow Man as the zany protector of the British Isles in the madcap late "90s. You search text-rich portions of London for his sidekick, Deep Fried Beef Fat Boy, last seen absentmindedly wandering the city in a hangover-induced amnesiac stupor. Collect clues and essential superhero supplies from Watford Station to Picadilly Circus and all points (well, several points) between, taking one of the least efficient routes possible between the grottiest bathroom in old London Towne and the convoluted subterranean labyrinths hidden in its sewers.  Descriptively over-wrought, its lush verbiage will overwhelm as much as its minimal scripting underwhelms.

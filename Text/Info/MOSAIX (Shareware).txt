MOSAIX is a computerized jigsaw puzzle program. Unlike other PC based jigsaw puzzle programs, MOSAIX is designed for use with photographic quality color images, rather than cartoon pictures. The puzzles presented by MOSAIX may be created using a video image capture board, a black and white scanner or a color scanner. Since MOSAIX can import standard PCX graphics files, puzzles may also be created using almost any PC paint program.

Forever Legend is a freeware role-playing game inspired by Final Fantasy series. A young child from the outside world came into the realm of ordinary people from the huge meteor. The child, named Kilgaly, grows up to become a hero who has to vanquish evil and save his land. Gameplay is divided into overworld traveling and turn-based battles with menu options such as "attack", "magic", "item" and "run". The overworld is viewed from a top-down perspective, which switches to a side view during battles, like in Final Fantasy games.

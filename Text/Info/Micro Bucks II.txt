Micro Bucks II is an updated, standalone version of the Micro Bucks slot machine game that was part of The Las Vegas EGA Casino.

The game is a simulation of a classic slot machine you"d find at any Las Vegas casino. You can insert up to five credits to play on up to five lines. The more you bet, the higher the chances you have of winning something - and the higher payout you can win.

People who registered the game also got a free copy of Big Bertha, a computer game replica of a large slot machine that used to be in a gambling hall in Reno, Nevada. You can bet up to three coins at a time, and you earn different payouts depending on the combination you get - up to 50,000 credits. The game features sound effects and music, too.

Mind Warp is a matching game whose object is to match pairs of identical symbols until the entire display grid has been exposed. The grid displays 2O rectangles on the ShareWare version. The player selects two rectangles which expose a colorful symbol in each selected rectangle. Points are awarded each time a pair of symbols are matched. The point values constantly change each time a rectangle is chosen. Prior to selecting your first rectangle, the point value for a correct match of the two symbols will be displayed. These values will change randomly. Mind Warp can be played by one or two players.

Corridor 8, or Corridor 8: Galactic Wars, was the planned sequel to Corridor 7. The game was in development but was never finished because the developer, Capstone Software, went bankrupt along with their parent company, IntraCorp. The game only made it to prototype stage. In 2005, Les Bird released the prototype and source code to a Corridor 7 fan, who put it onto his website as a free download.

This is the only known version to exist.

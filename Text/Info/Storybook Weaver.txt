Yet another excellent edutainment title from MECC, Storybook Weaver is the perfect incentive for developing writing skills, allowing children to express their creativity with pictures and sounds.Storybook Weaver is designed for kids who want more than just a sheet of paper to jump-start their creative writing. Young writers choose between themes like - outer space, a king"s castle, oceans and more, and then pick from a variety of characters available to fit with the almost never ending choices of scenery. 

Story starters are provided for those that need them. It seems that the creative design of this program is unlimited, as there are dozens images that can be added to the pages, and kids can even change themes of each scene, such as the time of day. With a very user-friendly interface, plenty of cartoon scenes and images to choose from, and a wide range of other options, Storybook Weaver provides the creative excitement to encourage children to want to write more. Two thumbs up, way up!

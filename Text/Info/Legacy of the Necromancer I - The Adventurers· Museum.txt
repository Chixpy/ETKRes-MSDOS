LEGACY OF THE NECROMANCER
\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 
Over 150 years have passed since the Necromancer"s downfall and death in the Great War and times have been relatively peaceful since then.\u00a0 Your visit to the Adventurers" Museum seems harmless enough, but the trip to the Palace of the Necromancer that follows causes you to become aware that a force for great evil is arising.\u00a0 In the end you must journey to the Black Lands of Bakarok and destroy the evil force.\u00a0 What you find and do in the Dark Tower will ultimately determine whether or not the Necromancer"s final legacy is to be a world filled with darkness and despair.

Legacy of the Necromancer consists of three different text adventure games.\u00a0 The three games share a common thread, yet each game is a complete and separate story unto itself, thus allowing you to play the games in whatever order you choose.\u00a0 Each game has a vocabulary of over 400 words and understands sentences as complex as TAKE ALL BUT THE IVORY DAGGER AND THE RUBY OUT OF THE EXHIBIT CASE.

Part I: The Adventurers" Museum - The Adventurers" Museum has been robbed by a wily demon, who has hidden his stolen loot away in a nearby cave, setting up traps and obstacles for the unwary person attempting to regain the treasures.\u00a0 While passing by the museum you are asked by the museum"s curator to find the stolen treasures and return them to the museum.

Part II: The Palace of the Necromancer - In search of treasure you follow a magic map to the Necromancer"s former stronghold in the north, a great palace built into the side of a mountain.\u00a0 Within the palace you must dodge wandering orcs, learn to turn lead into gold, and figure out the ways past various obstacles while searching for treasure and discovering the palace"s secrets.

Part III: The Dark Tower - Your explorations have revealed that the world is in serious peril from an ancient evil.\u00a0 Vandar the wizard has given you the dubious task of seeking out and destroying that evil.\u00a0 Your failure could mean the end of all that is good in the world.\u00a0 You must wander the Black Lands of Bakarok and explore the Dark Tower, searching for things to aid you in the destruction of this evil force while eluding and outwitting orcs, demons, and other former servants of the Necromancer.

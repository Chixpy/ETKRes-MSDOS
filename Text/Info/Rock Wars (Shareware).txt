Rock"N"Roll Trivia Game

This program started out as a game that I could sell at local record collecting conventions, but I soon realized that it could have appeal to any music fan. I wrote this Shareware version to advertise the game. It is a vastly shortened version of the complete game, which I"m making available through the mail. Ordering instructions can be found in the final screen of this Shareware version. Dealer inquiries are welcome.

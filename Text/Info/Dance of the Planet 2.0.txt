Easily the best astronomy software ever until its later versions and Maris" Redshift 3, Dance of the Planets was recommended by my astronomy professor.It"s a surprisingly versatile program, given its small size, that is capable of simulating everything from lunar phases to comet paths. Animations of planets are well-done, and the huge database of sky objects make for excellent star maps to take  with you for real stargazing sessions.Highly recommended for aspiring astronomers.

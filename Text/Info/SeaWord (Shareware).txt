SeaWord is also an animated instructional game where one or two players dive for sunken treasure in marine-inhabited waters by guessing letters to spell a customized list word. When two players play, the object is to see who can get the most treasure chests. When one player plays, he must spell the word before running out of oxygen and have to surface. The first time a student guesses a letter, the scuba diver jumps off into the water. Every time a student successfully guesses another letter, the diver goes deeper and one of ten marine creatures swim across the screen with accompanying music. When the word is finally spelled, the winning diver finishes diving to the bottom of the ocean, retrieves the treasure chest, surfaces, and stashes his treasure chest aboard the boat.

"When we last saw our hero, he was returning home to Earth after vanquishing the evil Gorkon Armada and foiling their plot to destroy the universe as we know it. In anticipation of a hero"s welcome (and party), Spiffy Spaceguy was pouring his first celebritory martini, envisioning the grand gala reception that awaited him.

SUDDENLY, a panicked voice crackled over the radio. Stirred but unshaken (ha ha), Spiffy Spaceguy turned to the controls of his ship and listened...

""MAYDAY, MAYDAY! We are under attack by the K"irjnarr fleet! We can"t stop them, there"s--there"s too many--anyone, help! Come in! Stop them before they reach Earth! No, no! Oh, the humanit-- *KSHZZZZZZT*

Cursing, Spiffy Spaceguy threw his martini glass out the window (ha ha) and punched in the hyperdrive. Like it or not, he knew that he was the only pilot good enough to stop the massive K"irjnarr fleet and save Earth. With a blinding flash, Spiffy Spaceguy"s ship leapt forward, disappearing into the vast emptiness that is space...

His celebration will have to wait."

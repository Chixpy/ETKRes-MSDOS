Year, 65000 B.C., aliens are invading the earth. Larry, a dinosaur and your team of five other dinosaurs have been assigned to rid these aliens of the face of the earth. 

You and your team go into the mountains where the aliens started to invade. You fight them, but every once in a while a team member would die by getting eaten by rockmonsters, mutilated by jelly blobs, guts getting sqeezed out by dangerous plants, or stepping on blobs that detanate when you step on them. Larry is the only one left. He
must finish the job. It may seem like a suicide mission, but if anybody can do it, Larry can, or will he?

Meanwhile, two dinosaurs, Matt and Gary, are hiking in the mountains that the aliens are invading. They discover some of Larry"s team members dead, and the hideous creatures that killed them. They are now trying to escape off of the mountain before
they die. Will they make it Alive?

On the aliens side, Xenophobe is the leader of them all. He has the command of all the aliens. If you destroy him, you won the battle, but have you won the war?

Your just going to have to play the game to see how this epic story ends. Can you survive the horror?

"Poker Solitaire, sometimes called Poker Squares, is a solitaire card game that rewards both lucky guessing and accurate calculation of odds. Card games, by their very nature, are very well suited for computer adaptations, since the computer can take care of tedious tasks such as dealing the cards, keeping track of legal moves, and score-keeping, leaving the player free to concentrate on the game itself. After writing a set of routines to draw high-resolution cards for use in my Klondike program, I decided to explore other solitaire card games, and as a result Poker Solitaire 1.1 was released on November 1988.

This is a major revision of the original Poker Solitaire program. The graphics routines are better and faster, the user interface is much more polished, and new variations and scoring options have been included. While there are some IBM-PC implementations of Poker Solitaire available both as public domain or shareware programs, I feel that this is by far the best one around."

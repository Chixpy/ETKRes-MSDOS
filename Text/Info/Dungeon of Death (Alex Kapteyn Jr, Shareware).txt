Dungeons of Death is a first-person perspective role playing game, similar to classics like Dungeon Hack or Eye of the Beholder. The game"s graphics are not great, but the gameplay is simple and intuitive. There is no long story or complicated control scheme. Attacking monsters is done by timing presses of the Spacebar, which is a lot tougher than it sounds! Overall a quick and enjoyable game, with maps randomly generated each time you play!

Arguably Angelsoft"s best game (alongside Stephen King"s "The Mist"), High Stakes casts you as intrepid gambler Steven Scott who finds himself on countless misadventures one after another.The author of the book it is based on is Dick Francis, a former jockey, who became best-selling author of crime/thriller novels, all set in a horse racing environment. The game is as "exciting" as interactive fiction can possibly get, with a lot of intense, real-time action sequences in which you must make split-second decisions (or typing, as it were) to save Dick"s life. The action starts right away in the beginning scene, when you must escape from a truck.

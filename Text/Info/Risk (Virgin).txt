The Computer Edition of Risk is an official conversion of the classic Parker Brothers board game.  Two to six human and/or computer players attempt to conquer the world with their armies.  All the rules of the board game are here, including trading in Risk cards and rolling dice.  Computer players have three different skill levels, which you can change during the game.  You can even change players between computer and human in the middle of the game.

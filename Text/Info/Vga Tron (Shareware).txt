The object of game is to be the last player alive in the round. Each player leaves a trail to mark where they have been on the play field. If you bang into your trail, your opponent"s trail, the exterior wall, or any other obstacle, you will die (for that round). Play continues until only one player remains. To add to the game, you have limited control over the speed of your ship -- you have 3 turbo bursts per round. When you press the key corresponding to your turbo bursts the speed of your ship increases for a random amount of time. You can increase your speed while a turbo burst is in effect, thereby further increasing your speed. The maximum speed possible is four times faster than normal. To make the game more interesting, you can only control going faster, not slowing down (which is controlled by a random timer). Each players also has four bullets which can be used to create an opening in an opponent"s trail. Make sure to fire early, since the small explosion created can destroy your ship if you run into it. Also, each player has the ability to jump over trails or obstacles four times. The distance you travel in the air depends on your current speed. You must be closer to the object you are jumping at lower speeds since you will not travel as far as you would if you were going faster.

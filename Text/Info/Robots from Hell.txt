Very interesting puzzle, in which you as the white ball to get away from the red balls - the evil robots. game consists of several levels (the same set) and is not limited by time, but rather complex. The playing field consists of blue, black and red cells, and a blue one with a flashing white box (output). Blue cells - those which can be moved (and a hero, and the robots can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally), black - instant death (robots do not go there), red - too death, but the robots go there. Each level has some robots located on it and after the first turn, players are usually (but not always) are also beginning to move - if the distance from them to our ball pretty close. Robots tend to walk the shortest distance, so the challenge game - try to lure them into red cells (exposed to them - instant death). However, the goal - it is to escape from the level, and not to kill all the robots on it (although the murder of each are given extra points.) Pro graphics can only say that it is and at the same time is good for a game. The only drawback - not too many levels. But some of them will be very difficult to pass, believe me. Plays a little-known, but because certain to be even more interesting to fans of non-trivial puzzles.

"TYPE TREK is a typing tutor in game format. As a game, it follows (loosely) the classic Star Trek games that originated on mainframe computers, where the goal was to seek out and destroy Klingon ships. (That was long before ""Star Trek: the Next Generation"" appeared, when Klingons were the enemy.) As a typing tutor, TYPE TREK introduces the keys on the keyboard, starting with the ""home row"" keys, and adding keys until the keyboard is mastered. Controlled drills are provided through the use of ""code words"" that fire phasers and photon torpedoes, move the Enterprise, dock and refuel, etc.

TYPE TREK can be enjoyed by experienced typists as well as novices. For example, Level 14 provides drills for the number keys (usually the top row of keys). Typing classes may not cover this row, since it really isn"t essential, so here is a chance to finally learn it. Level 15 provides a general review of all the keys.

There are so many keyboard layouts that TYPE TREK does not attempt to teach function keys (F1, F2, etc.) or specialized keys such as PgUp, PgDn, Insert, Num Lock, and so on. TYPE TREK concentrates on the ""QUERTY"" layout -- the alphabetic, number and punctuation keys (including the SHIFT keys and the space bar) normally found in the middle area of typewriters and computer terminals."

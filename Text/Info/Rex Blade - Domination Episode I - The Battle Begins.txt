In the 35th century, man has created some incredibly advanced cyborg to use as slaves, but eventually they rebelled and started a war. The human race has won, and forced to emigrate the cyborg on planets in another solar system, but now they are organized and eager for revenge against their former masters. You are Rex Blade, a cyborg who is on the side of men, and your mission is to eliminate the enemy before it is too late.

Rex Blade: The Battle Begins is the first chapter of a planned trilogy of first-person 3d shooter. The game engine is less advanced than Doom and is similar to the Wolfenstein 3D one, with some graphical improvements like transparent walls; enemies and objects are sprite-based. In each level there are terminal, with an operating system like DOS (referred to as "REXOS"), with which you can use some commands (DIR, HELP, CLS ...), read clues on how to find the exit, or play simple 2D games like "Starblazer", a clone of Asteroids.

This is the only chapter published independently: the other two (Rex Blade: The Battle Rages On and Rex Blade: The Final Encounter) were included in Rex Blade: The Apocalypse compilation. Xtreme Games has also published another compilation named Domination, with the same games but different titles: Domination Episode I - First Contact (as shareware), Domination Episode II - Netherworld Hell and Domination Episode III - The Final Conflict.

It"s a top-scroller that uses a "Your move-My move" system. This is multiplied about 30 times because every enemy on the level is allowed a move for every one of yours, but they don"t all know where you are right away. It has a good and somewhat optional storyline, for the replay factor. When you create a new character you can distribute ability points between three characteristics, and select their gender and name. The levels and weapon abilities are randomly generated for an extremely high replay value.

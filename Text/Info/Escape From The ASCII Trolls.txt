Ever wanted to play funky puzzle/adventure game with ASCII graphics where you must flee or otherwise use your wits and collected items to flee from trolls? Well, if so, this is the perfect game for you! While the controls and interface need some getting used to (read the included docs before playing) this game is fairly unique, includes both puzzle and adventure elements, and yeah I"m always a sucker for ASCII games. :) (The author notes if you run this from Windows to be sure to maximize the window.)

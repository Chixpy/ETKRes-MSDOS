Hi! Necromason here with my second finnished QBasic game.

It"s a side-scrolling action game with cool VGA graphics.

It is the best game of it"s type!

So enjoy this wonderfully crafted QB masterpiece. (Well almost :> )

Story:

In the year 2097, an evil race of genetic and cybernetic creatures arose to conquer humanity.

Led by the satanistic V-Tron robot they seemed unstoppable.

They destroyed cities and annhilated soldiers in the millitary"s attempts to stop them.

Finnaly an alliance between most nations on Earth called the United Governments built a cyborg powerful enough to stop V-Tron: Cynet.

This one man army was given the most powerful gun made: the Nerolizer, a jetpack and a no-crap attitude.
He is set down by a Commanche helicopter in V-Tron"s base.

Now sit back, buckle up and get ready for the QBasic game ride of your life!

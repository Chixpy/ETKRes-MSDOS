Cyber Police is a Final Fight-inspired arcade game set in the future. As a member of Cyber Police, your mission is to maintain the law and order from the evil henchmen of the Blue Scorpion gang, which are trying to sow chaos everywhere they go. To do so, you will have to make your way through the different scenarios that make up the city to try to locate Jemiah, the ruthless leader of the criminal gang. There are several characters with which to carry out your purpose (two robots: Perseus and Ishrall and one man: Duncan Dahoh), each one having its own characteristics.

As in other beat em up"s, you will normally fight fist to fist (or kick to kick), but when you defeat your enemies you will be able to carry their weapons until you receive an impact. With one button you will attack and with other you will jump.

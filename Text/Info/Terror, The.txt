The Terror is a top-down vertical scrolling arcade shooter.

It features 9 scrolling levels, 5 large bosses, 7 weapons, over 12 unique enemies, 256 colors, & the story is shown in game cutscenes. It is fully playable under Windows.

This is an excellent little space shooter which offers a great storyline and a lot of fast shootin" action. However, it lacks any sound effects or background music (the background music we can live without). The lack of sound effects really detracts from the enjoyment of a game.

That aside, the other elements of the game are well crafted and you could quickly find yourself becoming addicted to The Terror.

Worth grabbing!

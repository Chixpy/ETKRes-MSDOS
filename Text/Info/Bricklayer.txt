Bricklayer for Windows is a port of Steve Chamberlin"s popular fast-paced falling blocks game for the Macintosh.  The Macintosh version was honorably mentioned in the 1993 MacUser Shareware Awards, and favorably reviewed in numerous books and magazines.  

Guaranteed to get you addicted, Bricklayer for Windows features beautiful 256-color artwork, an original music soundtrack, terrific sound effects, and more.  Systems which are not 256-color or sound-capable are also supported.

Version 1.50 adds an automated computer player and a game recording feature.

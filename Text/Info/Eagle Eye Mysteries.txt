Eagle Eye Mysteries is an educational game which incorporates some unique gameplay ideas not seen in many other games. A bit like Law and Order for kids, the game has over 50 different mysteries to solve, ranging from missing items to dug up skeletons to mysterious sea monster sightings to sculpture forgeries.

With the help of Jake and Jennifer Eagle, you must interrogate suspects, gather information, and then decide on the culprit. Though intended to help improve reading comprehension and problem solving skills, Eagle Eye Mysteries can be a challenge for adults as well.

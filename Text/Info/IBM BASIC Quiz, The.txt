This follow-up to The Computer Quiz features the same engine, but its hundred questions deal with the BASIC programming language.  As before, the player is given three "men," and loses a man every time a question is answered incorrectly. Bonus men can be earned by answering ten questions correctly. At the end of play, men are cashed in for points, meaning that the best possible score is 113.

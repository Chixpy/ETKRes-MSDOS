Sounds Like A... is a unique and entertaining game for children ranging in age from 1 1/2 to 7 years of age. The program uses colorful graphics, high-quality sounds, and MIDI music in four entertaining activities. In the first activity the child must find the picture which matches a sound. Your child may hear, for example, a cow mooing. He will then click on a square containing the picture of a cow. A game consists of 12 sound/picture pairs. As each picture is matched with the accompanying sound, parts of a larger underlying picture are revealed. The second activity uses the same concept with songs. Your child will match a picture to the song being played. There are 36 songs included - 12 children"s songs, 12 Bible songs, and 12 Christmas songs. The third activity is a matching or memory game with a slight twist. The child must match a picture with the appropriate sound. For example, if the child clicks on a block revealing a picture of a donkey, he must find the block which contains the Hee Haw sound in order to make a match. In the last activity, your child can manipulate an on-screen tape recorder to play any of the sounds or songs in the program.

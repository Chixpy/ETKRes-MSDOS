Three years after the events of Xerix, Earth and its colonies is again attacked by aliens. The alien ships come in waves, and blindly move about in patterns, including the bosses, so the enemy isn"t exactly intelligent. They make up for that in numbers. There are a lot of weapon upgrades which, unfortunately, don"t carry from one level to the next. A very long story is told before each level which, fortunately, can be skipped. The graphics are layered, with a foreground (a layer closer than the ship) as well as a background layer. The greatest strength of this game is the excellent soundtrack, which varies from techno to African tribal music with very convincing wind instruments. This is a challenging game, so fortunately there are three difficulty levels. There are 12 levels in this game, with only the first 6 playable in the shareware version.

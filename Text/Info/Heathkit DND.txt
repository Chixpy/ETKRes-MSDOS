This is another version of DND, originally written for the Heathkit Z-150 computer"s GW-BASIC, and later compiled for DOS. Apart from featuring colored text graphics, the game is quite similar to the original, it"s a solo dungeon crawl using Dungeons & Dragons rules. Goal of the game is to find the Lord Master of the 50 level Heathkit Dungeon. 

At the beginning of the game, you can choose to start a new game or play with a saved character. You then enter the dungeon and start exploring on the 1st level. During the game, you will see a text-based 3x3 top-down overview of your surrounding, while status information is displayed on the right and messages below. The whole game is played in timed delay -- it is turn-based, but you have only some secounds to enter your choice for each turn, so don"t take too long!

During the game, you will encounter monsters (there are 20 different types, each with several levels, ranging from Gnolls and Skeletons up to Vampires, Demons and Dragons), which you can fight to gain experience points. Of course, there are also traps and treasures on your way, the latter containing gold or helpful items like Elven cloaks or magic scrolls. You can rest to restore spell points and save your character in taverns strewn in the dungeon. Spell points can also be refreshed by donating and worshipping at altars -- all in all, the game features 36 spells, which you will learn by advancing levels. Other things you may encounter are stairwells, teleports and gray misty cubes (acting like an elevator for all 50 levels).

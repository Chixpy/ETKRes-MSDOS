This touch-typing tutorial includes a few games to help players practice when they"re not taking lessons.  The first, "Touch Typing Tests," simply involves typing sentences quickly.  The second, "Tic-Tac-Toe," gives the player a Tic-Tac-Toe board.  Each turn, he or she selects a square and is given a sentence to type.  If the sentence is typed quickly enough and contains no errors, the square is won; otherwise, it is given to the computer.  The final game, "ESCAPE," has the player running away from an enemy.  A letter always appears in the box in front of the player.  Typing this correctly sends the player forward, but making a mistake sends the player back.  If the enemy catches the player before the end of the course is reached, all is lost.  Each of these games features adjustable difficulty levels.

This Tetris clone has a few slightly unusual features: it is possible to control the game with either mouse or keyboard, and the player has a great deal of control over the size of the playing field and which shapes are included.  There are three preset collections of shapes (Size 4, Size 5 and All Liths), or a totally customized assortment can be manually selected.  There is also a Challenge mode in which things start simple, but progressively more complex shapes are introduced as the game goes on.

In this adventure game, you control the amateur inventor Elandra, who has to help amateur rocket builder Mickey Farley with his ambitious project. All he needs is some fuel and materials, and he"ll be able to launch his rocket into space. It won"t be easy to get them though. 

The game is controlled with a mouse; similarly to Sam & Max Hit The Road, right-clicking changes the cursor action (Walk to, Look at, Interact with, Talk to), while moving the cursor to the top of the screen makes a menu appear, allowing you to easily change the cursor actions, access one"s inventory or save/load/quit the game.

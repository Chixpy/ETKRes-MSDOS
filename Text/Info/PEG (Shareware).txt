No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some stories trace it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most likely the game is even older.  PEG presents variations on the classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.  Requires mouse/VGA.

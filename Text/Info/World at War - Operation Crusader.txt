Consisting of 5 single-battle scenarios and one campaign game, you are trusted into either the Allied or the Axis side using a modified version of the V for victory engine with the same wargame mechanics but with several additions such as more realistic fog of war, the ability to select different types of attacks, from low-intensity probes, to all-out assaults. You can play vs a human opponent via e-mails or take on the computer using a "Random Variant" option which guarantees some surprises on every game.

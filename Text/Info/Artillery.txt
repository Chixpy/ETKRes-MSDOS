An artillery game for two human players, who get placed on both sides of a randomly-selected landscape and proceed to take turns lobbing high explosives at each other.  Each side commands a gun company with 100 men: these unfortunate meat-shields tend to die even on a near-miss, and a direct hit will kill them all.  Perhaps realizing that, one man deserts his post after each turn, on both sides.  The first side to wipe out the opposing force is the victor - until the next battle.

Shots are fired by entering an angle and a velocity; the terrain is destructible, so craters can chip away at the landscape, or cause a player"s gun to drop into the resulting pit. Ballistic trajectories are also affected by wind speed, which can be constant or variable (if variable, a difficulty level is chosen to determine the magnitude of the changes).

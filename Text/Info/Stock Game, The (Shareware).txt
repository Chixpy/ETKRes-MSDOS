"If you always wanted to go from rags to riches, THE STOCK GAME lets you make your millions without risking a penny. It is designed to be similar to the real stock market without losing its ""game"" status by becoming so full of rules that the fun is lost. Specific rules will be discussed later in this documentation. I suggest that some users might consider THE STOCK GAME as an educational program.

Besides the usual buying and selling, THE STOCK GAME allows margin purchases and short selling. There are various kinds of ""news reports"" that affect both individual stocks and the overall market as one proceeds through the game. A market analyst will give recommendations (for a fee) and you can look at the trading history of the stocks once you have played a few ""years"". There are up to six players permitted in each game. One of them may be the computer or even a mutual fund."

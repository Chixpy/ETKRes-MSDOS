Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth game in Al Lowe"s Leisure Suit Larry series. All the events from the previous games are forgotten. Larry is once again single, and again his goal is to capture the interest of various ladies. By sheer coincidence, Larry finds himself on a TV Game Show called "Stallions". He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry! Uh... or is it really so? It is your goal to find out! Using your wit, you should solve all the puzzles and satisfy the wishes of all the ladies!

This instalment focuses more on conversations with women and on puzzles than on the storyline. The entire game is spent at La Costa Lotta. There are plenty of traditional inventory-based puzzles to solve in the game. You can die, but are allowed to try again every time that happens, without the need to restore. This is also the first Larry with SVGA graphics, and voice-overs in CD version.

Heavily armored and armed space platforms are in need of obliteration. Hop into your megadestroyer and shoot down countless enemies, turrets, and command centers in MegaDestroyer Frantis. This rapid paced top down shooter lets you direct a fighter and shoot enemies in a contained battle field. You have three lives to accomplish each level but have plenty of shields and power-ups such as invisibility to aid your fight. Levels are passed once all base enemies are killed and there are nine levels in total.

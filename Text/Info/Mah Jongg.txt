Mah Jongg is a solitaire tile-matching game first invented on the computer in 1981. It can best be described as a memory & strategy puzzle game. The images on the tiles are from the 19th century Chinese game of Mah Jongg (a board game for four players).

One tile set comes standard with the unregistered version. Registered users receive special files making it possible to create their own tile sets and use other pre-designed ones.

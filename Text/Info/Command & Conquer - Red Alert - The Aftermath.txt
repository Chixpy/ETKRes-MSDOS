The Aftermath is the second add-on to Command and Conquer: Red Alert. 

This add-on introduces new fully playable units - Chrono Tank, Demolition Truck, Field Mechanic, Tesla Tank, Shock Trooper, M.A.D. Tank, Phase Transport and Missile Sub. There are 18 new campaign missions, 9 for each side. They are not connected with any storyline whatsoever, much like in Red Alert: Counterstrike, so they can be played in any order.

The Aftermath also adds yet another 100 multiplayer maps and 8 all-new battle songs, expanding the soundtrack to 35 tracks.

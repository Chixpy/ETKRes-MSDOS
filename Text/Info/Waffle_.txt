collection of odd things. If you"ve ever wanted to see a dead frog pop out of a toaster or shove the pope off of a building, this is the game for you. It"s CGA and it"s fairly old, but I added a speed control so you can play it on a fast computer if you have to.

Just don"t keep pressing gajillions of keys trying to skip past the intro
if you"re impatient. If you do, the program will eventually get pissed and
make you run it again. Just WAIT until the intro"s over, okay people?!?

Welcome to The Awe-Chasm.. "A bit of an iffy adventure"... The first of many adventures to be created with the C Adventure Toolkit.

Oh, are there cameras on me? Right, (rustle, rustle) where was I?  Oh yes! Hi! Well folks, here it is, the looong awaited sequel to Snatch and Crunch.... The Awe-Chasm, Snatch and Crunch II.

When writing this adventure, I set myself the task of creating an adventure that felt, tasted and smelt real.  I spent many many midnight hours, toiling away whilst idly glancing at cable TV, and then... I realized it couldn"t be done (groan). So, here is an adventure that neither tastes, smells or feels real, but is "hopefully" a mite different from the average.

Like all the best strategy games, CASCADE is easy to learn and
 yet tough to actually master. On playing the game you are presented
 with a maze of letters, scattered with balls and other objects.
 Each player (you v Computer) takes turns to remove a letter, and
 the balls cascade down the gaps left. On reaching the bottom, they
 will enter your hopper and add a value to your score. This value is
 normally 1, but is changed if a ball hits a NEGATOR or DOUBLER in
 its travels. NEGATORS and DOUBLERS act as TOGGLES - ie. hitting a
 DOUBLER once turns the mode on, hit it again and its switched off.
 Hitting a BONUS is normally worth 4 points, although this becomes
 -4 points if NEGATE mode is on, or double that if DOUBLE mode is on.
 If you hit a flask of GELIGNITE you will clear a path adjacent to
 that square. When you hit a REGENERATOR, part of the maze is
 regenerated, and some extra balls are dropped in at the top.

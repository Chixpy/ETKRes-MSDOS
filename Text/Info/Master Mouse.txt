Master Mouse is a friendly game, where your Mouse is meant to collect as much Cheese and Dollars as possible.  A nasty Boa is trying to catch your Mouse.

Collecting 20 pieces of Cheese, you are allowed to the next game level.  Each piece of Cheese brings you 100 points, each Dollar - 1,000 points.  Every 20,000 points you are awarded with an extra Mouse.

Your Mouse is a peaceful creature and has no weapons.  His only defense is to drop a Stone behind, that delays Boa for a few seconds.

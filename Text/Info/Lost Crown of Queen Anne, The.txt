This game, part of the Classic Adventure Series, has the adventuresome player searching for Queen Anne"s crown, which was lost in the eighteenth century and last seen in the Arabian desert.  Although entirely text-based, the game takes a somewhat visual approach to interactive fiction.  The screen is split into several boxes: an area description (which specifies visible exits), an inventory, a list of visible items, an auto-map and a list of verbs.  Several statistics are tracked at the bottom of the screen: score, moves, hunger, thirst and number of treasures found (out of 12).  Replay value is enhanced by the fact that certain elements of the game are randomized.

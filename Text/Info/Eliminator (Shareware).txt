Eliminator is a remake of a classic game best known as light cycles in the movie Tron. What sets Eliminator apart from all the other versions of this game that I have seen is that while Eliminator still allows two people to play head-to-head against each other, if you are unable to find an opponent that is either willing to play or enough of a challenge to play you may invoke the help of the Eliminator (the computer).

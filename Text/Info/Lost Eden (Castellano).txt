Lost Eden is an adventure game set on an eerie planet populated with dinosaurs.

Your civilisation is menaced. Armies of Tyranns, led by Moorkus Rex, are gathering around your kingdom. Soon they will swarm in, destroy everything and kill your people. However, there is a single hope. There are legends telling that several hundreds of years ago, men and dinosaurs cooperated to build 5 mighty Citadels that were almost invulnerable to the Tyranns. Today, all the Citadels but one have been destroyed.

You play as Adam of Mo, you must rediscover the secret of uniting men and dinosaurs, rebuild the Citadels, and finally defeat Morkus Rex and his armies.

Lost Eden is a first-person adventure that utilizes  Myst-style navigation through pre-rendered backgrounds that represent locations. However, the gameplay is less heavy on environment-manipulating puzzle-solving than Myst, having more in common with traditional adventure games with their inventory-based puzzles.

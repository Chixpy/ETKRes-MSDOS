This a game Pac-Man clone oriented to encourage you to seek a college degree. No kidding!

You run around in the maze, and instead of dots, you have to collect as much as possible A"s, while avoiding the following monsters:

Goofoff: Bad study habits advocate

Chicky: Applier of peer pressure

Boozer: Drunken "waste case"

Junky: Drug dealing "slimer"

Oh, and remember: "This diskette may only be copied in its entirety and only for the purpose of encouraging youth to seek a college education."

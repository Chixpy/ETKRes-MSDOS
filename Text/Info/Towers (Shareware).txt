The object of Towers is to get all 52 cards stacked in increasing order by suit, just like Solitaire. At the start of the game, the suit locations are empty. The first card placed on the suit location must be the appropriate Ace. Once the Ace is there, the Two can be placed on top of it, and so on up to the King. Towers has the option of automatically moving cards to the suits when possible.

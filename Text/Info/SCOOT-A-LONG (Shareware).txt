"SCOOT-A-LONG is a program that will certainly provide the User with hours, upon hours, of total playing satisfaction. This game provides an excellent game board, with emphasis on detail. This is a game that can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players. The sound can be toggled off and the sound effects of the Dice (Shaking) can be set to one of eight speeds, to compensate for the User"s computer system (speed).

The computer does not play, so you must have at least two human players."

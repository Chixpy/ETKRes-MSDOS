It looks quite complicated at first, but this game is basically about shooting stuff. You select your ship, different options, etc, and then enter the battle. The game has some nice graphical effects, but since you usually only fight 1-2 enimies at once it"s not very exciting. Still it looks good and there seem to be many different campaigns you can fly on. (PLEASE NOTE: If the game runs too fast for you, it"s likely you will have to run this game with the -vga option. To do this, go to DOS and type "pixships -vga" to run the game.)

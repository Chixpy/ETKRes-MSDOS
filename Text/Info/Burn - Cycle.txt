You play data thief Sol Cutter in a very Johnny Mnemonic -like plot. You have just pulled off a major data theft, but in doing so you"ve infected yourself with a neural virus, named Burn:Cycle, which will literally turn your brain into goo in 2 hours. Unless, that is, you can find a cure while you simultaneously try to avoid the people whom you stole the data from.

Why are they chasing you if you"re gonna die anyway? How do you get rid of this virus? What does it all mean? You"ll try to figure that out in this  game which plays like a Cyberpunk Journeyman Project, in full screen and with more action sequences. Gameplay consists of first-person action and puzzle sequences spiced up with video in-between.

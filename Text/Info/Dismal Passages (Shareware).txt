The ancient land creeps into the dark of midnight.  Knarled trees bend slightly under the night time air.  The black of the new moon falls against the starred sky.  Behind the corpse of trees a small hut sits against a garden of healthy vegetables.  Out of the quiet midnight, a howl begins.  The howl grows louder as the breeze turns into a ferocious torrential force.  A black inky void spreads over the night sky, directed toward the hut.

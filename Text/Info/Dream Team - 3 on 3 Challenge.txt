Another solid action sport game from Data East, Dream Team: 3 on 3 Challenge plays like a good remake of Electronic Arts" Jordan vs.Bird, except that the players you control are more generic, and the control method a little more intuitive. As the title implies, the game is a simulation of 3-on-3 basketball game, which is played on half the normal basketball court. You can compete in an exhibition game, or up to 8 players can join a tournament (which is really just a sequence of 8 consecutive games). Instead of being a pure action sport game like Data East"s earlier Monday Night Football, Dream Team offers several strategic options that should please diehard fans, including a playbook, full player statistics, and rule choices e.g. standard rules vs. 3-on-3 rules, the length of each quarter, freepass view, and so on.

Data East"s hallmark of excellent controls in its console games is evident here, as you can move, pass, and shoot the ball at varying power with ease. The game even offers a two-player "teammates" mode, where two players can play in the same team against the computer. Overall, Dream Team is a very enjoyable game. It may not match TV Sports Basketball in terms of capturing the atmosphere of a live match, but it is a great choice for anyone looking for a quickie. Thumbs up!

As an ACME Detective Agency greenhorn in the pursuit of Carmen Sandiego, you employ your Chronoskimmer 450SL to travel through time in the search of the next clue that eventually results in the recovery of the stolen item, apprehension of the theif, and the eventual capture of Carmen herself.

Not much new in terms of the basic premise, all trivia questions relate to American History...obviously.  The graphics are greatly improved over previous Carmen Sandiego games.

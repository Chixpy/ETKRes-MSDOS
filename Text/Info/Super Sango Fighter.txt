As the title suggests, this game is an ingenious home-brew game that pits fighters from Sango Fighter against those from Super Fighter in the ultimate fighting match.Death Adder did a great job ripping all graphics, sounds, and animations from the two games and combine them into an enjoyable gaming experience.

Similar to other Davidson classics, Spell It Plus! is a very comprehensive package that includes both learning and testing components. There are five mini-games that teach the concepts in several different ways: you can decode the words, find and replace incorrect words, unscramble sentences, or simply learn the vocabulary at your leisure. The interface is very intuitive and well organized: every option can be selected from menu bars, and there are plenty of hints and comprehensive rules for every activity, making the manual unnecessary.

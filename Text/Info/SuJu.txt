The game of SuJu was derived from the word game of Jumbles. In the game of SuJu, you are shown four scrambled words. Two of the words contain five letters each, the other two contain six letters each. These words must be unscrambled to form four common words you"d find in the dictionary. Each of these words contains one or more mystery letters. As each of the words are solved, the mystery letters will appear. Once all the words have been solved, you"ll have all the mystery letters exposed which form a mystery answer. You must now unscramble the mystery letters to form the mystery answer. Once that has been done, you"ve completed the jumble.

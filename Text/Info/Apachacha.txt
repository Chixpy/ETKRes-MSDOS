Apachacha is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, starring a Native American warrior who must save the land from an evil demon and his minions. The player advances from stage to stage in a strictly linear fashion. The stages themselves are fairly straightforward, dominated by enemies rather than hazards. The warrior can accumulate and use several throwing weapons simultaneously, and also execute a powerful melee attack that depletes his special energy bar. This bar can be restored with items left by enemies upon defeat. Each stages ends with a boss battle. There is no save feature in the game.

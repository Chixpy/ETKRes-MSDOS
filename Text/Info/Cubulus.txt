A fun variation of popular Rubik"s Cube, Cubulus features attractive graphics and simple yet potentially addictive gameplay.The goal is simple: use the up and down arrow keys next to each row of colored blocks to match their pattern to the given one in the lower left corner. There"s a time limit to each level, so you have to be fast. At higher difficulty levels (there are 4 total), the game gets extremely difficult as there are literrally hundreds of blocks on the screen, with dozens of rows and columns you must contend with. A two-player mode is available, but it is not fun as both players just take turns instead of competing against each other in a split-screen mode. Overall, a fun game that"s perfect for fans of Rubik"s Cube, but is too derivative to hold anyone"s interest for long.

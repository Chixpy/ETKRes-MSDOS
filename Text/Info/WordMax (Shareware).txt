The objective of Wordmax s to spell as many words as you can using letters from a master word. The game includes plenty of masterwords to try, and it has a built-in dictionary of over 80,000 other words, so it"s likely the game will recognize the words that you type. Presentation (as with all Soleau Software games) is excellent.

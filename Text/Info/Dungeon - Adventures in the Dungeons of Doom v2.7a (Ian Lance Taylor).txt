Dungeon\u0009is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory\u0009ever seen by mortal man. Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within.

In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost\u0009labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

Dungeon\u0009was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels and Dave Lebling. It was inspired by the Adventure game of Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and\u0009Dragons game\u0009of Gygax and Arneson. The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE). The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.

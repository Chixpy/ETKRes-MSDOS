Part of a 4 part series, Jesus Matchup is a Concentration game focused on teaching about Jesus and the Bible.

The game is played just like a regular Concentration game, where you must match up pairs of cards that are face down.  1-3 players can play, and the winner is the player with the most pairs at the end of the game.

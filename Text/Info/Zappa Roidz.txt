In Zappa Roidz you fly around in a space ship and you have to shoot all the asteroids and aliens you encounter. When you shoot a large asteroid it will break into smaller asteroids that you also have to shoot. On a map you can see where all the asteroids and aliens are. Your space ship can be destroyed by colliding with other objects. When you have lost all your space ships the game is over.

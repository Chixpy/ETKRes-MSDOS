The Infernal Tome is a multi-character fantasy role-playing game.  You and four characters must collect weapons, armor, spells, potions, keys, and tokens to defeat monsters.  You and your party must proceed through the maze of ShardMoure Keep to retrieve the Infernal Tome, a powerful manuscript that can stop time itself, before the evil Lord B"Nah and the Shadow King can gain possession of the Tome.

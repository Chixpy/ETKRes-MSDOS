Strategy-based one or two person boardgame. DOS.

Mancala! is a terrific strategy-based boardgame where you play against the computer or against a human opponent.

The idea is to move as many stones as you can into your "mancala" (the storage area on the right-hand end of the board) until all the stones are gone.

There are some rules/strategies to learn before you can master this program but it is very enjoyable and will keep you amused for hours.

The interface is excellent, the options good, and the download is a tiny 46kB (even better!).

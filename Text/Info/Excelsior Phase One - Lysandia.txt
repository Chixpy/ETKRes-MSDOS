Excelsior is a tile-based RPG (in the vein of the early Ultima games). It places you on the planet of Lysandia with the goal of eliminating the chaotic presence threatening the planet.

The game follows traditional RPG concepts, including character creation, a variety of weapons and magic spells, skill sets (such as swimming, music, and seamanship).

The game provides a number of quests and side-quests designed to bring your character closer to completing the goal of liberating Lysandia.

Take control of one of the existing Formula 1 teams (or one of two customizable fictitious ones) and try to take them to the top of the start in this management simulation.

Every major decision is under your control. You must choose which parts of the car to improve, including Driver Aids whose legality varies over the years - is the extra performance worth the risk of disqualifications? Testing will help you assess the car"s performance and prepare set-ups for the next race. Staff can be hired and fired, ranging form drivers to designers and commercial staff, which often means trading off having a large team, or a small but well-drilled and capable one. Obtaining and retaining the interest of sponsors and engine manufacturers is a crucial challenge as the years go on.

Once the race weekend comes around, you must make the best use of practice and qualifying sessions, as well as preparing a pit strategy and being ready to adjust it if incidents, weather or unexpected performance issues occur. The action is viewed from overhead, with full commentary. There are also 5 Challenges, which set you a specific task based on one changed variable (such as bank balance, driver skill and engine supply).

NOTA: La comunidad de Grand Prix Manager 2 ha seguido activa durante muchos años y en la página GPM2World.com podemos encontrar numerosos mods de temporadas recientes -hasta 2011- además de muchas utilidades. Para usarlos es necesario instalar el parche 1.02b que hace el juego incompatible con Win 3.11 pero compatible con Windows 95/98/XP e incluso en algunos equipos con Vista/7 -no en todos-.

You"re Jean-Luc Picard (best known from "The Next Generation" episodes), captain of the Federation starship USS Enterprise-D, on a mission to encounter an ultimate threat to the known galaxy. The game starts with a Federation outpost detecting an unknown ship approaching Federation space; the Enterprise is sent to deal with this new situation. The mystery ship appears to be a small scout-ship from Garid that has lost power to its engines and as a result has sailed off of its intended course. Before you can blink however, a Romulan Warbird battleship from Garid uncloaks itself right between you and this new ship and this is only the beginning of the game"s story. With many more unexpected encounters to follow, the game develops into a rather large and well crafted story that you"ll be sure to dive into and relish.

Jump into an F-18 fighter jet and take on enemies as you cruise over the ocean in Miramar, Jet Fighter Simulator.

You"ll take off with your jet from a carrier and once you cruise to a required altitude face fierce opponents who want nothing but to shoot you down into the drink. Your instrument panel will help keep you level and ready to attack. The radar will guide you and your sidewinder missiles into the opposition. And remember to watch your gas gauge to see when you should land and refuel. 

This game sits somewhere between simulator and arcade shooter by allowing you to select the level of fidelity you"d like over controls.

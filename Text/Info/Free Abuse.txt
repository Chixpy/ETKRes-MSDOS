Abuse is a side-scrolling action game with a unique control system. You move the player with the arrow keys, while you aim his gun with the mouse. In the original shareware version, released in 1995, there were four levels, and a highly flexible level editor. The registered version, available for DOS, came with IPX support and lots of new items and fun stuff. Abuse was programmed by Jonathan Clark and start-up developer Crack Dot Com. The retail version was published by Origin and Electronic Arts, and can be found today in a number of action-game compilations.

fRaBs is just a silly acronym for "Free Abuse". It has the network support of the registered version, but also comes equipped with many new single player and deathmatch levels, as well as additional enemies and artwork, all coming from outside, free sources. A list of updates and modifications can be found in the updates section. As far as I know, there is no material in this archive that is not public domain. I sure hope that the acronym is justified. :-)

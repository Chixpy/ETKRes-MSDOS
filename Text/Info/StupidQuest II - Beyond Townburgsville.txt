This one looks a whole lot better than the first, with lots of nifty DOS Ansi-windows and stuff. It"s also a lot bigger. Takes place RIGHT where the first SQ left off! 

-Dedication-

This game is dedicated to lint, without which there would be far
less lint in the world.

-Check This Out!-

Alright...I did a massive format change here. Instead of being a
pure Zork-esque text adventure parody, this here game uses an ascii-windows
interface just like all your favorite dos programs! I"ve also added the
option to PROGRAM YOUR OWN DAMN F-KEYS, since I got so many complaints from
people who wanted "Kill Lawyer" or whatever. The game load/save thing is
much easier and doesn"t create a bunch of files. And the coolest thing:
THERE"S A MENU-DRIVEN BATTLE SEQUENCE! There"s one-handed and two-handed
weapons, different weapons do greater amounts of damage, and you have the
ability to BLOCK if you are using a one-handed weapon. What else...oh yeah,
when you restore your saved games you go RIGHT BACK TO WHERE YOU SAVED THE
GAME.

-The Plot-

You remember where StupidQuest left off? Of COURSE you do...you
wouldn"t DARE play SQ2 without first beating the original, would you?

WOULD YOU?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?!

Anyway...this game picks off RIGHT after the end of StupidQuest.

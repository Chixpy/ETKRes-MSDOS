"Welcome to the world of Treasures & Terrors. There is a nest of dragons that are threatening to destroy the land. You have set out to destroy these dragons.

There are many obstacles that must be overcome on the way. The treasures found will prepare you for the adventures ahead. Not all is as it seems in Alteria. There are devious people out for their own gain. They can help you for a greedy price. There are bartenders, but they aren"t much help. Nobody trusts nobody anymore. Rumors have aroused that the King is making a deal with the head dragon to protect the land. It is rumored that he intends to sacrifice a woman every month to the nest in exchange for yearly attacks instead of monthly.

The people are worried. They used to love their king, but now they aren"t sure. There are hidden divisions among the castle tenants. Sir Radics and The Royal Wizard haven"t been seen for weeks!

You must set things straight! Right the wrongs! Save the Land!"

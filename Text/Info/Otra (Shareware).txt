"Do you remember Simon?

Simon was a hand-held electronic game, introduced in the mid 1970"s. In it, you were challenged to reproduce an ever-growing sequence of flashing lights and musical tones, using four colored buttons.

Its great success and simplicity spawned a huge number of imitators, and was largely responsible for the hand-held electronic game craze which continues to this day.

Otra (from the spanish ""otra vez"", or ""one more time"") is a computerized memory game in the spirit of Simon."

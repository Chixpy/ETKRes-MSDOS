A somewhat uninspired shareware puzzle game, Apocalypse Abyss doesn"t have much you haven"t seen in many other puzzlers.You must guide a dwarf to the exit of each room through a variety of obstacles, pushing boulders, blowing up enemies, and gathering treasure. Unfortunately, this is a pretty standard design, and the game doesn"t quite measure up on its own merits. Puzzle design is lackluster, treasure collecting is pointless, the game is short, and I only found one of the rooms in the game challenging.

If you like the boulder-pushing, laser-avoiding, enemy-dodging action found in many other shareware puzzlers, Abyss might be worthy of a brief diversion, but no more.

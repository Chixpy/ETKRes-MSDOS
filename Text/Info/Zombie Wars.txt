The Sequel to Alien Carnage/Halloween Harry, Zombie Wars picks up the story three years later as the aliens return to enslave the Earth. 

Harry is joined by Agent Diane as they race through zombie infested parks, sewers, beaches, office blocks, factories and alien ships and undertake the prerequisite undead destruction with primarily ranged weaponry, in a 2D action side-scrolling style.

Aquanoid is a straight Breakout variant. The player controls a paddle which is positioned at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right. At the upper part of the screen are a variety of blocks and the goal is to destroy them all by bouncing a ball between the blocks and the paddle - when the player fails to bounce the ball back a life is lost. When the ball touches a block. it disappears. However, there are different blocks with varying properties, e.g. some may require multiple hits or can"t be destroyed at all. In some occasions, a destroyed blocks drops a power up which has an effect on the gameplay when picked up with the paddle.
